\section{Thermal compensation system comissioning for O3}
Since the comissioning that had taken place in O3a, there has been heavy consideration into how point absorbers limits the high power operation of interferometric gravitational wave detectors and hence their sensitivity; from pre-installation measurements of ITM surface quality to the consideration of higher order thermal compensation.

\section{AlGaAs Electro-optic effect}
The discovery of driven mechanical couplings within the longitudinal pockels cell mount are discussed and was shown to be a major limitation when using large \textcolor{red}{(Mention range)} electric field injections indicated and have lead to an improved dual-polarization locked experimental design for improved sensitivity.

\textcolor{red}{Satoshi results}
Though with limited sensitivity an upper limit with the experiment is established \textcolor{red}{cite paper with Satoshi notes}.

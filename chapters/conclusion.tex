\section{Adaptive optics comissioning for O3}
Since the comissioning that had taken place in O3a, there has been heavy consideration into how point absorbers limit the high power operation of interferometric gravitational wave detectors and hence their sensitivity. Some considerations include but are not exlusive to: pre-installation measurements of ITM surface quality, upgrades to TCS for higher order thermal compensation modes, and halting observing altogether to replace an offending test mass mirror. 

\section{AlGaAs Electro-optic effect}
Though with limited sensitivity an upper limit with the experiment is established. The discovery of driven mechanical couplings within the longitudinal pockels cell mount are discussed and was shown to be a major limitation when using large \textcolor{red}{(Mention range)} electric field injections indicated and have lead to an improved dual-polarization locked experimental design for improved sensitivity.

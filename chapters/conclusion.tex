The discovery of driven mechanical couplings within the longitudinal pockels cell mount are discussed and was shown to be a major limitation when using large \textcolor{red}{(Mention range large)} electric field injections indicated and have lead to an improved dual-polarization locked experimental design for improved sensitivity.


\textcolor{red}{Satoshi results}
Though with limited sensitivity an upper limit with the experiment is established \textcolor{red}{cite paper with Satoshi notes}

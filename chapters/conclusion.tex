\section{Adaptive optics comissioning}
Since the comissioning that had taken place in O3a, there has been heavy consideration into how point absorbers manifest on the core optic surfaces and ways to mitigate their effects if unavoidable. Some of these considerations include but are not exlusive to: non-invasive pre-installation measurements of ITM surface / coating quality \cite{dcc:paNSFupdate2022}, upgrades to TCS to expand upon the current thermal compensation actuation modes, and scheduleding vaccum chamber venting specifically for replacing an offending test mass mirror.

Increasing interferometer input power is an inevitability to reaching designed detector sensitivity and developing mode matching contingency plans seem to be a natural progression of the current adaptive optics schema. The technique for improved ring heater transient response represents a small iterative step of pushing the existing and future thermal mode matching infrastructure towards a larger scale evolving adaptive optics schema. Some next immediate steps within the author's limited view:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Improved measurement and filter fitting of the RH thermo-optic response
	\item Improving the thermo-optic transient of the CO2 actuators with unique pre-filters using the procedure listed in \autoref{appendix:rhcontrolpf} 
	\item Improving TCS synchronization when raising input power to potentially improve the thermo-optic carrier transient from the high circulating arm power.
	\item Optimization of simultaneous thermo-optic transients between actuators and the carrier 
\end{itemize}

Though with limited sensitivity an upper limit with the experiment is established. The discovery of driven mechanical couplings within the longitudinal pockels cell mount are discussed and were shown to be a major limitation with driven electric field injections indicated and have lead to an improved dual-polarization locked experimental design for improved sensitivity. Some next steps that can be taken with a similar experiments:

\begin{itemize}
	\item More narrow investigation into improved mechanical isolation to improve SNR at low frequency
	\item Careful modelling of opto-mechanical resonances to improve a model to inform a required separation (if any) between the photo-elastic and electro-optic effects 
\end{itemize}

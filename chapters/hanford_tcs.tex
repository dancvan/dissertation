\section{Motivation}
As seen in ~\autoref{sec:detcon}, increasing detector input power leads to a direct sensitivity increase to gravitational waves. And even using optics with ultra-low absorption ($\approx 328 \; \mathrm{ppb} \pm 84 \; \mathrm{ppb}$), significant thermo-optic effects persist, especially with a designed circulating arm power of 750 kW in the Fabry-P\'{e}rot cavity arms ~\cite{tvo, aligo:2015}. Thermal aberrations produced from the high circulating carrier power include substrate lensing and relatively smaller lensing from the differential HR surface curvature. The time varying optical path length change integrated over the carrier phasefront produces mode mismatch and contributes to the accumulated optical loss throughout the GWD, reducing sensitivity two-fold: 1) by loss of usable readout power, and 2) reduced efficacy producing squeezed light states in lowering the detector quantum noise limit.
\\
During O3a the LIGO Hanford observatory increased circulating arm power beyond 180 kW; emphasizing importance on properly tuned thermal compensation in O3 to avert arm-cavity/carrier-beam mode mismatch. Detailed in this chapter is a summary of related comissioning efforts at LHO to prepare and preserve interferometer mode matching including but not exclusive to: a primer on the ALIGO adaptive optics schema (TCS), citations on the initial computed O3a TCS pre-load, the development and implementation of real-time digital filtering for an improved ring heater actuation response by a factor of $\approx 6$, and the impacts of high absorption points aka point absorbers discovered on arm cavity test masses along with efforts to mitigate them.

\subsection{Thermal Compensation System}
High power beams, even propogated by ultra low absorption mirror substrates and coatings, can impart a surface pressure that imposes non-negligible thermo-optic distortions via thermo-refractive and thermo-elastic effects~\cite{hellovinet:1990}. The ALIGO adaptive optic system is intended to address the problem of dynamic mode mismatch in high power interferometry; as high power operation is a requirement in reaching designed sensitivity. The system is comprised of a feedback control system that uses four Hartmann wavefront sensors (HWS) combined with thermal actuators of two varieties: annular ring heaters and CO2 lasers heating~\cite{diss:brooks}.  

\subsubsection{Actuation}
Both ITMs and ETMs (Fabry-P\'{e}rot arm cavity mirrors) are strategically monitored for differential lensing, but both are not prescribed equal actuation treatment. All arm cavity mirrors do posses negative lens ring heater actuation in the form of a wound nichrome wire annulus that outlines the outer barrel of the mirror substrate; while CO2 lasers, though not imaged onto the ITMs directly, are instead imaged onto a fused silica compensation plate (CP) \footnote{Decouples CO2 laser noise from the highly sensitive FP input test mass position} placed promptly before the FP arm input coupling mirror ~\cite{brooks:aigwd2019}.

\subsubsection{Sensing Optical Path Distortion}
Quantifying thermal distortion from both carrier as well as thermal actuators is performed with a set of four Hartmann wavefront sensors; each one measuring differential optical path distortion at each FP cavity test mass. The sensor probe beams \footnote{Differing wavelengths of 800 nm and 833 nm are chosen for the X and Y arms in order to mitigate crosstalk between HWS chains and other auxilary systems} make a double pass through the test mass mirror substrate for all arm cavity mirrors and map the HR mirror surface; while the two input test mass sensors at the interferometer vertex make an additional double pass through the compensation plate (CP). Wavefront distortion maps are then used to compute relevant Zernike polynomial coefficients (i.e. $Z^{l \shorteq 0}_{n \shorteq 2}$) in real time to inform of differential defocus in diopters ~\cite{aasi:2015}.



\subsection{Thermo-optic transients}
Thermo-optic transfer functions from high power carrier beams and implemented thermo-optic actuators suggest that these thermal transients are worthy of consideration to avoid long periods of mode mismatch while sampling points in actuation space.

	\label{fig:TCSinp}
\end{figure}

The thermo-optic time constant of the carrier beam self-heating is similar to that seen from CO2 laser / CP central actuation, though demonstrably different from annular ring heating. Because of this, LHO applies central CO2 heating and static annular ring heating to a power level that respectively mimics and actuates for projected thermal deformation from circulating resonant carrier in the Fabry-Perot arm cavities. Once DRFPMI coupled cavities are configured or ``locked'', the input carrier power is gradually increased while CO2 laser power is simultaneously decreased in order to mitigate any possible differential thermo-optic response from the arm cavity test masses when reaching maximum power.

\section{Dynamic Thermal Compensation}
Transient ring heater actuation from a radially symmetric thermal aberration ($\Psi(t,r)$) is realized in ~\cite{ramette:2016} and measured here:

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
     \includegraphics[width=.85\textwidth]{TCS/IRHF/Meas_response}
     \caption{ITMY thermo-optic response to a 3.13 [W] combined power reduction to the top and bottom ring heater elements. It's after $\approx$ 12 hours after the ring heater power control step do you start to see a small enough steady state differential defocus ($\frac{\mathrm{d} \alpha_\mathrm{sp}}{\mathrm{dt}}$) and can assume a steady state thermal lens. }
     \label{fig:RHresp}
\end{figure}

The measured transient thermo-optic response exhibits differential defocusing for $\approx$ 12 to 15 hours once the ring heater power has been changed; and with a large enough power steps, these adjustments to ring heater power can significantly stall precious detector observing/comissioning time due to differential mode matching. Thermo-optic time constants are reduced by applying real time digital filtering to ring heater power controls. The desired thermo-optic response is one that resembles a step from one defocus state to another with no overshoot. 

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{TCS/IRHF/RH_control_diagram.pdf}
	\caption{A simple controls diagram depicting the concept of a RH control pre-filter (\textbf{G(s)}) taking a step input (\textbf{u(t)}) and transforming it before reaching the thermo-optic plant (\textbf{H(s)}) with output can also be generalized to an adaptive optics control loop.}
	\label{fig:RH_control}
\end{figure}

The RH power control transient ($\mathrm{u}(t)$) resembles that of a Heaviside function ($\Theta(t)$), motivating an inversion of the response function which provides a reasonable first order filter correction. Therefore, the prescription for creating an input filter is realized through inverting the known RH step response with additional low passing at high frequency to avoid aliasing due to low sampling rate of the slow control system. However, a full inversion of the thermal $1/f$ roll-off at high frequencies would lead to an infinite control signal on short time scales. Since the ring heater output is physically limited by its maximum power (10 Watt), as well as zero (no heating) for negative signals, a necessary constraint for the input filter to work with any command input is that its high frequency gain is less or equal to its DC gain. In the time domain, this guarantees that the initial fast transient is less or equal to the output required over long timescales. This condition can only be violated if extra control headroom can be guaranteed by some other means. See figure \autoref{fig:rtdf_pictograph} and \autoref{fig:dynam_comparison}. \swb{In previous paragraph: replace "avoid any high frequency control instability" with "avoid aliasing due to the low sampling rate of the slow control system." Furthermore, add "However, a full inversion of the thermal $1/f$ roll-off at high frequencies would lead to an infinite control signal on short time scales.

    \label{fig:dynam_comparison}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Reducing Parametric Instabilities}
Another symptom of resonant high power optical cavities are parametric instabilities (PI); induced by the opto-mechanical interaction between test mass acoustic modes and higher order optical modes. PIs present a threat to achieving designed detector sensitivity, even driving the detector to lockloss. Passive methods of mitigating PIs by way of acoustic mode dampers (AMD) demonstrate significant reductions of problematic mechanical modes though some (i.e. @ 15 kHz) remained problematic during O3a. Lingering PIs required manual intervention by way of adjusting test mass / cavity geometry to disrupt persistent modes and is now a much more feasible solution with DTC \cite{hardwick:2020}.  

\subsection{Limitations}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.86\textwidth]{TCS/IRHF/IRHF_compare_filts_PI_paper}
    \caption{Comparison of the natural RH response and the response to the filtered input with RH power}
    \label{fig:RH_power}
\end{figure}
When constructing the control pre-filter important considerations the physical limits of the thermal actuators need to be considered. For the ALIGO RHs, a 10 W limit is set on RH power control and sets a threshold on the high frequency gain of the pre-filter \cite{dcc:rhspec}. Failure to consider this limit may cause the actuator output to rail the inital power swing from your actuator response.
\\ 
There must also be considerations when we cannot assume the scaling of this function is not linear and time-invariant. \swb{Replace "the scaling of this function is not linear and time-invariant" with "that we know the control output history over the last 15 hours."} Concurrent RH changes an example of this as the filter is designed with inital thermal equilibrium in mind. There is room to develop a more rubust Dynamic Thermal Compensation strategy, with enough modeling, independent measurements spanning an actuation space, and integration of Kalman Filtering.

\section{A priori TCS pre-load methodology for O3a}\label{sec:tvopreload}
Preserving arm cavity resonance requires countering the positive thermal lens defocus of the nominal test mass lens induced by high circulating interferometer arm cavity power. Preparing for uniform test mass distortion from the carrier beam requires calibrated and well established thermal actuator settings; informing a `pre-load' of the TCS actuators using test mass absorption measurements. Initial order of magnitude estimates of wavefront distortion from ultra-low absorption fused silica test masses under the influence of a centered high power gaussian beam as well as annular ring heater actuation are available \cite{hellovinet:1990, ramette:2016}; though variations of the absorption between any two test mass mirrors are accounted for through calibrated defocus measurements using the Hartmann wavefront sensors sensitive to auxilary beams imaged onto the test mass mirror surfaces.

  \label{fig:O3_ITMY_preload_tvo}
\end{figure}

\section{A posteriori thermal compensation for O3a}
While approaching designed arm cavity power, the presence of non-uniform high absorption points on the test mass coating surface imposed limits to reaching designed power and hence designed sensitivity; simultaneously, this lead to a significant deviation from the original TCS pre-load algorithm. The current thermal actuation solution is designed to control the TEM00 beam waist size and location, though adjustments and modifications of current actuators were tried. Assessment of these absorbers helps inform of ways to mitigate their effects with the hopes of reaching the designed detector sensitivity. We begin here with a characterization of these high absorbtion points including: characteristic optical path distortion profiles measured on the Hartmann wavefront sensors, as well as some impacts on interferometer operations at high power. The findings mentioned here indicate that these absorbers pose a risk to maintaining and reaching designed circulating power in the arm cavities if no further proactive measures are taken, or are not sufficient to bypass detector symptoms; whether they are a result of preventable surface particulates or can be masked with an improved adaptive optics schema.  

%The presence of high absorption points on the test masses (aka point absorbers) required adjustments to the TCS pre-load and various ring heater and CO2 settings were sampled. Part of this sampling lead to the development of a input ring heater filter allowing actuation to reach ? percent of the desired optical power within 2 hours compared to the 12 hour response pre-filter. Higher spatial frequency actuation in the form of a CO2 mask wac also tried.

\subsection{Point absorption in O3a}
A significant number of lockloss events during the O3a comissioning period were a direct result of select optical sideband power degredation used to maintain the delicate coupled cavity configuration during interferometer thermalization at input power $\geq$ 100 kW circulating in the FP arms. This was quicky realized to be caused by high absorption points discovered on ITMY.

  \caption{An isometric view of point absorption vs uniform cooling of the LHO ITMY.}
  \label{fig:ITMYpabs}
\end{figure}

Also, while sustaining interferometer DC readout the recycling cavities would generate higher order modes, sustained by a Output Mode Cleaner (OMC) co-resonance which contaminates the carrier field at the output photodiode. With continued observation and comissioning at high power ($\geq$ 180 kW) point absorbers were also discovered on ETMX, though difficulties profiling due to unavoidable probe beam noise on that wavefront sensor.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Reduced Power Reycling Gain}
As informed by \autoref{eq:PRG} the PRG can provide a reasonable metric for the arm losses in the FPMI and in fact suffered notable reductions with interferometer thermalization. At LHO there are reported PRG losses of $\approx 13\%$ increasing IFO input power from 2W to 30W, while LLO notes a $\approx 18\%$ change while increasing input power from 2W to 40 W ~\cite{elog:2019_01_21:cahillane}.

\subsubsection{Frequency noise}
A beneficial feature of interferometry is the ability to filter common mode noise (i.e. laser intensity and frequency noise), though these benefits are contingent upon the ability to preserve arm symmetry. Intentional asymmetries, for example the Schnupp asymmetry \footnote{A macroscopic differential length offset introduced in order to pass optical sidebands for normal interferometer functionality and stability} are well known and designed such that common mode noise remains low. Meanwhile, common arm mode interference is exacerbated proportionally to the amount of mode mismatch.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{TCS/NB_1235813418.pdf}
    \caption{A DARM noise budget during O3a~\cite{elog:2018:dwyer}. Beneficial features of interferometry, i.e. common mode noise rejection requires adequate mode overlap at the beam splitter. Destruction of such symmetry as mode overlap proportionally destroys such benefits and demonstrate a presence in DARM. Here in this noise budget Frequency noise (at high frequencies) and Intensity noise (at low freqencies) are about 2 times above the designed noise level. \swb{Re[place "both Frequency and Intensity noise are about 2 times above the anticipated noise level." with "Frequency noise (at high frequencies) and Intensity noise (at low frequencies) are about 2 times above the design noise level."]}}  
    \label{fig:high_freqnoise}
\end{figure}

Thorough investigation of the LIGO frequency noise determined the proportional increase of the LIGO frequency and intensity noise with increased power~\cite{buikema:2020}.

\subsubsection{Control signals}
Holding delicate resonance conditions throughout the coupled cavity configuration necessitates a resonable optical sideband relative carrier gain (dBc) for the PDH loops to function. And it is with careful planning that the macroscopic recycling cavity geometry is planned so that sideband resonance boosts the signal. The point absorber on an ITM directly impacted these sideband buildups and frequently lead to a lockloss.

%    \label{fig:pa_PRCL_lockloss}
%\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Higher order modes at DCPD}
For the detectors' DC readout configuration, power from higher order modes at the anti-symmetric port obscure the single element photodiode from measuring a pure TEM00 mode with the increased shot noise~\cite{fricke:2012}. Among other higher order modes, the point absorber allowed resonance of a notable higher order mode (9th order Hermite-Gauss) from the 9MHz sideband which was co-resonant with the Output Mode Cleaner and in turn imparted intensity noise to the DCPD \cite{elog:2019_03_03:brown}.


\section{Results}
With these high absorption points dramatically impacting interferometer high power operations, a variety of efforts to mitigate their effects were sampled. Using DTC the amount of sampling possible TCS states increased (for varied RH states specifically) though the current modes of actuation proved to still be too few and/or mixed to rely on TCS alone with a static beam position on ITMY.    

\subsection{Custom CO2 mask}
Attempts at increasing uniform distortion with a machined CO2 mask \autoref{sec:CO2mask} was tried. The intention was to actuate by imaging a negative of the optical path distortion from the high absorption points onto the surface with the CO2 laser combined with a static ring heater offset \cite{elog:2019_02_17:brooks}. The installation location of the mask and size was established using the relevant propogation and imaging techniques applied to the CO2 actuation field while mitigation of the aforementioned impacts provided comissioners with mixed metrics of success \cite{elog:2019_03_28:mansell, elog:2019_02_22:brown}. With varying interferometer conditions and an involved parameter space, alongside the slow nature of thermal actuation, attempts at restoring uniform absorption proved to be not as straightfoward to improving the overall interferometer condition~\cite{brooks:aigwd2019, buikema:2020}.

\subsection{Beam position offset}
Comissioners found that the simplest and most accessible solution to reducing point absorber symptoms (i.e. decreasing power recycling gain, control sideband buildup, and reduced 9MHz intensity noise) was to shift the beam spot position on the offending test masses \cite{elog:2019_02_23:driggers} though this was not without having to change the entire interferometer alignment along with the loops that control it \cite{elog:2019_02_25:driggers}. Utilizing this solution also simplifies and reduces the TCS solution back to what was detailed in \autoref{sec:tvopreload}.
%\subsection{Interferometer to OMC mode matching}
%High absorption points also lead to significant offsets in RH and CO2 actuation for offending test masses leading to thermal offsets for observatory operation. This lead to further interferometer mode matching considerations and required more subtle actuation solutions than anticipated. Improvement metrics included the measurement of higher order mode content at the detector output as well as inserting dither lines in the feedback loops to track the movement of sideband buildups

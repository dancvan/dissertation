As shown in section ?,  increasing input power directly relates to an interferometer's sensitivity to detecting gravitational waves. This comes with a few implications, but one in particular is the necessity for thermal compensation. As the interferometer increases input power, you directly couple more light into the Fabry-P\'{e}rot cavity arms. The optics, even with super low absorption (~ ? ppb) cannot help but deform with the projected circulating arm power of 200 kW. THe

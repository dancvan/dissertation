\section{Motivation}
As seen in ~\autoref{sec:detcon}, increasing detector input power leads to a direct sensitivity increase to gravitational waves. And even using optics with ultra-low absorption ($\approx 400 \; \mathrm{ppb} \pm 150 \; \mathrm{ppb}$ \textcolor{red}{alog ? or point absorber paper}) there still are induced thermo-optic effects with a designed circulating arm power of 750 kW in the Fabry-P\'{e}rot cavity arms. Predicted thermal aberrations produced include a substrate lens with relatively smaller lensing from the differential HR surface curvature. This time varying optical path length change integrated over the carrier phasefront produces mode mismatch and contributes to the accumulated optical loss throughought GWDs which reduces sensitivity two-fold: by loss of readout power, and reduced efficacy to produce squeezed light states in lowering the detector quantum noise limit.
\\
During O3a the LIGO Hanford observatory increased circulating arm power beyond 180 kW; emphasizing importance on properly tuned thermal compensation in O3 to avert arm-cavity/carrier-beam mode mismatch. Detailed in this chapter is a summary of related comissioning efforts at LHO to prepare and preserve interferometer mode matching including but not exclusive to: a primer on the ALIGO adaptive optics schema (TCS), citations on the initial computed O3 TCS pre-load, the development and implementation of real-time digital filtering for an improved ring heater actuation response by a factor of $\approx 6$, and the impacts of high absorption points aka point absorbers discovered on arm cavity test masses along with the some efforts to mitigate them.

\subsection{Thermal Compensation System}
High power beams, even propogated by ultra low absorption mirror substrates and coatings, can impart a surface pressure that imposes non-negligible thermo-optic distortions via thermo-refractive and thermo-elastic effects~\cite{hellovinet:1990}. The ALIGO adaptive optic system is intended to address the problem of dynamic mode mismatch in high power interferometry; as high power operation is a requirement in reaching designed sensitivity. Comprised of a feedback control system that uses four Hartmann wavefront sensors (HWS) combined with thermal actuators of two varieties: annular ring heaters and CO2 lasers. 

\subsubsection{Actuation}
Both ITMs and ETMs (Fabry-P\'{e}rot arm cavity mirrors) are strategically monitored for differential lensing, but both are not prescribed equal actuation treatment. All arm cavity mirrors do posses negative lens ring heater actuation in the form of a wound nichrome wire annulus that outlines the outer barrel of the mirror substrate; while CO2 lasers, though not imaged onto the ITMs directly \footnote{Decouples CO2 laser noise from the highly sensitive FP input test mass position}, are instead imaged onto a fused silica compensation plate (CP) placed promptly before the FP arm input coupling mirror ~\cite{brooks:aigwd2019}.

\subsubsection{Sensing Optical Path Distortion}
Quantifying thermal distortion from both carrier as well as thermal actuators is performed with a set of four Hartmann wavefront sensors; each one measuring differential optical path distortion at each FP cavity test mass. The sensor probe beams \footnote{Differing wavelengths of 800 nm and 833 nm are chosen for the X and Y arms in order to mitigate crosstalk between HWS chains and other auxilary systems} make a double pass through the test mass mirror substrate for all arm cavity mirrors and map the HR mirror surface; while the two input test mass sensors at the interferometer vertex make an additional double pass through the compensation plate (CP) ~\cite{aasi:2015}.


\subsection{Transient thermo-optic response}
Thermo-optic transfer functions from high power carrier beams and implemented thermo-optic actuators suggest that transient are worthy of consideration to avoid long periods of mode mismatch while actuating.

\label{fig:thermooptic_response}
\end{figure}
The thermo-optic time constant of central carrier beam self-heating is similar to that seen from CO2 laser / CP central actuation, though demonstrably different from annular ring heating. Because of this, LHO applies central CO2 heating and static annular ring heating to a power level that respectively mimics and actuates for projected thermal deformation from circulating resonant carrier in the Fabry-Perot arm cavities. Once DRFPMI coupled cavities are configured or ``locked'', the input carrier power is gradually increased while CO2 laser power is simultaneously decreased in order to mitigate any possible differential thermo-optic response from the arm cavity test masses when reaching maximum power.

\section{Dynamic Thermal Compensation}
\subsection{Ring heater / test mass thermo-optic response}
Transient ring heater actuation from a radially symmetric thermal aberration ($\Psi(t,r)$) is realized in ~\cite{ramette:2016} and measured here:

\begin{figure}[H]
     \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{TCS/IRHF/Meas_response}
     \caption{ITMY thermo-optic response to a 3.13 [W] combined power reduction to the top and bottom ring heater elements. It's after $\approx$ 12 hours after the ring heater power control step do you start to see a small enough steady state differential defocus ($\frac{\mathrm{d} \alpha_\mathrm{sp}}{\mathrm{dt}}$) and can assume a steady state thermal lens. }
     \label{fig:RHresp}
\end{figure}

The measured transient thermo-optic response exhibits differential defocusing for $\approx$ 12 to 15 hours once the ring heater power has been changed; and with a large enough power steps, these adjustments to ring heater power can significantly stall precious detector observing/comissioning time due to differential mode matching. Thermo-optic time constants are reduced by applying real time digital filtering to ring heater power controls. The desired thermo-optic response is one that resembles a step from one defocus state to another with no intermediate overshoot. 

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.6\textwidth]{TCS/IRHF/RH_control_diagram.pdf}
	\caption{A simple controls diagram depicting the concept of a RH control pre-filter (\textbf{G(s)}) taking a step input (\textbf{u(t)}) and transforming it before reaching the thermo-optic plant (\textbf{H(s)}) with output can also be generalized to an adaptive optics control loop.}

\end{figure}

    \label{fig:justplant}
\end{figure}

As the queried RH power resembles that of a step, inverting this step-response can provide a feasible first order filter. Therefore, the prescription for creating such a filter is realized through inversion of the well known RH step response alongside additional low passing at high frequency to avoid any control instability at high frequency \footnote{see appendix for more detail}

    \label{fig:dynam_comparison}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Reducing Parametric Instabilities}
Another symptom of resonant high power optical cavities are parametric instabilities (PI); induced by the opto-mechanical interaction between test mass acoustic modes and higher order optical modes. These PIs present threats to achieving designed detector sensitivity, even driving the detector to lockloss. Passive methods of mitigating PIs by way of acoustic mode dampers (AMD) demonstrate significant reductions of problematic mechanical modes though some (i.e. @ 15 kHz mode) have remained problematic. Lingering parametric instabilities required manual intervention by way of adjusting test mass / cavity geometry to disrupt these persistent PIs, and is now a much more feasible solution with DTC \cite{hardwick:2020}.  

\subsubsection{Limitations}

Limitation on RH power control is set at 10W. \cite{dcc:rhspec}

\section{A priori TCS pre-load methodology for O3a}
Preserving arm cavity resonances requires countering the positive thermal lens defocus of the nominal test mass lens induced by high circulating interferometer arm cavity power. Preparing for this central uniform test mass distortion from the carrier beam requires calibrated and well established thermal actuator settings which in turn informs how much to `pre-load' the TCS actuators using early estimates of test mass absorption. Initial order of magnitude estimates of wavefront distortion from ultra-low absorption fused silica test masses under the influence of a centered high power gaussian beam as well as annular ring heater actuation are available \cite{hellovinet:1990, ramette:2016}; though variations of the absorption between any two test mass mirrors are accounted for through calibrated defocus measurements using the Hartmann wavefront sensors sensitive to auxilary beams imaged onto the test mass mirror surfaces. Measured wavefront distortion can then be mapped in real time to Zernike polynomial coefficients (i.e. $Z^{l \shorteq 0}_{n \shorteq 2}$) to compute a differential defocus in diopters.

  \label{fig:O3_preload_tvo}
\end{figure}

\section{A posteriori thermal compensation for O3a}
While approaching designed arm cavity power, the presence of non-uniform absorption on the test mass coating surface imposed limits to reaching designed power and hence designed sensitivity; which simultaneously lead to a significant deviation from the original TCS pre-loading algorithm.  Assessment of these absorbers can inform methods of improving detector sensitivity required and initial characterization of these high absorbtion points which includes noting the characteristic optical path distortion as measured on the Hartmann wavefront sensors and the impacts on interferometer operations especially at high power. Current thermal actuation solutions are currently designed to control the TEM00 beam waist size and location though adjustments and modifications of current actuators was tried. This summary indicates that these absorbers may impose a barrier to maintaining high power in the arm cavities if no further proactive measures are not taken or are not sufficient to bypass detector symptoms; whether they are a result of preventable surface particulates or improved higher frequency.  

%The presence of high absorption points on the test masses (aka point absorbers) required adjustments to the TCS pre-load and various ring heater and CO2 settings were sampled. Part of this sampling lead to the development of a input ring heater filter allowing actuation to reach ? percent of the desired optical power within 2 hours compared to the 12 hour response pre-filter. Higher spatial frequency actuation in the form of a CO2 mask was also tried.

\subsection{Point absorption in O3a}
A significant number of lockloss events during the O3a comissioning period were a direct result of select optical sideband power degredation used to maintain the delicate coupled cavity configuration during interferometer thermalization at input power > 100 kW circulating in the FP arms. This was quicky realized to be caused by high absorption points discovered on ITMY.

  \label{fig:ITMYpabs}
\end{figure}

Also, while sustaining interferometer DC readout the recycling cavities would generate higher order modes sustained by Output Mode Cleaner (OMC) co-resonance and contaminating the carrier field at the output photodiode.

With continued observation and comissioning at high power (>180 kW) point absorbers were also discovered on ETMX, though was difficult to profile with unavoidable noise on that wavefront sensor.

\subsubsection{Impacts}
\paragraph{Frequency noise}
One of the beneficial features of interferometry is the ability to filter common mode noise (i.e. laser intensity and frequency noise). Though these benefits are contingent upon the ability to preserve the arm symmetries. Destruction of such symmetry as mode overlap proportionally destroys such benefits and presents itself in DARM.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{TCS/NB_1235813418.pdf}
    \caption{DARM noise during O3a. Beneficial features of interferometry, i.e. common mode noise rejection require adequate mode overlap at the beam splitter. Destruction of such symmetry as mode overlap proportionally destroys such benefits and demonstrate a presence in DARM}    
    \label{fig:high_freqnoise}
\end{figure}

Thorough investigation of the LIGO frequency noise determined the proportional increase of the LIGO frequency and intensity noise with increased power \cite{buikema:2020}.

\paragraph{Control signals}
Holding delicate resonance conditions throughout the coupled cavity configuration necessitates resonable optical sideband relative carrier gain (dBc) for the PDH loops to function. And it is with careful planning that the macroscopic recycling cavity geometry is planned so that sideband resonance boosts the signal. The point absorber on an ITM directly impacts this buildup, frequently inducing a lockloss.

\end{figure}

\paragraph{Higher order mode at DCPD}
Power of higher order modes at the anti-symmetric port obscure the single element photodiode from measuring a pure TEM00 mode with the increased shot noise. 

\subsubsection{Attempted symptom reduction}
The trivial solution of reducing the test mass non-uniformity was tried but exhibited noticable limitations with the available degrees of freedom. To restore the uniformity of the test mass surface, a custom mask was constructed with the intention of imaging a negative of the optical path distortion high absorption points onto the surface with the CO2 laser combined with a static ring heater offset. 
The installation location of the mask and size was established using the relevant propogation and imaging tensors applied to the CO2 actuation field while mitigation of the aforementioned impacts provided comissioners with the notable metrics of success.

\section{Results}
The extremely strict alignment requirement introduced difficulties while attempting to fulfill the promise of restoring uniform absorption. And although the presence of the absorber symptoms show coorelation with their prominence at high power, their collective reduction proved to be not straightfoward~\cite{brooks:aigwd2019, buikema:2020}. 

\subsection{Custom CO2 mask}
A mask was installed in front of the CO2 laser actuator combined with a RH offset to attempt restoring uniform thermo-optic absorption, with inconclusive results on account of the narrow alignment requirement while attempting to improve sideband (PRCL) power buildup. 

\subsection{Interferometer to OMC mode matching}
High absorption points also lead to significant offsets in RH and CO2 actuation for offending test masses leading tothermal offsets for observatory operation. This lead to further interferometer mode matching considerations requiring more subtle actuation solutions than anticipated. Improvement metrics included the measurement of higher order mode content at the detector output as well as inserting dither lines in the feedback loops to track the movement of sideband buildups

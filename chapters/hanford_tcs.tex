As shown in Chapter 1,  increasing input power directly relates to an interferometer's sensitivity to detecting gravitational waves, one implication of this is the necessity for thermal compensation. As the interferometer increases input power, you directly couple more light into the Fabry-P\'{e}rot cavity arms. The input test masses, even with extra low absorption ($\approx 400 \; \mathrm{ppb} \pm 150 \; \mathrm{ppb}$ \textcolor{red}{alog ? or point absorber paper}) still induce thermo-optic effects with the projected circulating arm power of 200 kW. A symptom of this is mode mismatching throughout the interferometer, a problem that contributes to loss of optical power at the anti-symmetric port which can reduce sensitivity two-fold: loss of power to your readout and reduced efficacy of implementing quantum squeezing.

%% Electro-optic study of AlGaAs coated mirrors

 As mentioned in Section (1?) one of the many LIGO fundamental noise sources is coating thermal noise from the $\mathrm{SiO_2}/\mathrm{TiO_2:Ta_2O_5}$ aLIGO coatings. As aLIGO approaches its designed sensitivity various coating solutions are currently proposed to mitigate thermal noise coupling into the detector output.
With the potential to reduce coating Brownian noise by a factor of 10 \cite{Cole:2013}, $\algaas$ shows much promise with next generation detectors with a corresponding strain reduction by a factor of (5?) in comparison to the aLIGO coatings, though with different material properties of these crystalline coatings introduce new coating noise couplings.

A notable source of noise is the linear electro-optic property of the crystalline material (dn/dE), also known as the Pockels effect \cite{abernathy_poster}. Characterizing currently proposed $\algaas$ coated ``witness" samples thorough extensive analysis and experimental data of the aforementioned property is worthwhile for the use of $\algaas$ coatings in gravitational wave interferometers. The following section is dedicated to the discussion of brownian thermal noise and the fundamental limit it imposes on gravitational wave detection, the improvements of said limitations with $\gaas$/$\algaas$ coated mirrors over $\mathrm{SiO_2}/\mathrm{TiO_2:Ta_2O_5}$ coatings, the $\algaas$ linear electro-optic effect starting with the fundamentals on anisoptropic media and the electro-optic tensor of zincblende crystalline materials, estimates of the differential phase of light reflected from a GaAs/$\algaas$ coating, and an experiment constructed with the intention of measuring the linear electro-optic effect within a 1kHz $\rightarrow$ 1MHz region.

\subsection{Brownian Thermal Noise}
 In 1827 the Scottish botanist Robert Brown noticed a constant motion of pollen particulates on the surface of water; witnessing randomized collisions of the water molecules holding a kinetic energy proportional to the temperature ($k_BT$) \cite{Brown:1828}. It is because of his documented observations we name the phenomena Brownian motion. For high precision optical experiments operating at room temperature (and higher due to high power circulating beams), understanding how much differential phase noise is imparted on the interferometer light passing through and reflecting from core optics is crucial. This requires knowledge of the mean squared displacement from each degree of freedom of the system which can be realized through the Fluctuation Dissapation theorem. Derived by H.B. Callen and T.A. Welton, the theorem states that for a randomly fluctuating linear force \cite{Callen:1951}:

 %% Further insight into Brownian motion was explored by Einstein where he was able to relate the mean-square displacement of a particle of radius $r_\mathrm{sph}$ on a fluid with viscosity $\eta$.

 %%\begin{equation}
 %%\overline{x^2} = k_B T  \frac{1}{3 \pi \eta  r_\mathrm{sph}}
 %%\end{equation}

 %%This relation has important implications about how the random motion or fluctuations of a particulate (the pollen) is influenced (dissipated) by the viscosity of the surrounding medium (water).

\begin{equation}
F_x^2(f) = 4 k_B T\; \Re[Z]
\end{equation}

 \noindent Where $\Re[Z]$ is the real part of the impedance of the system. This impedance directly relates to equations of motion:

 \begin{equation}
 Z = \frac{F}{\dot{x}}
 \end{equation}

\noindent Another useful form is the power spectrum of the fluctuating motion:
\begin{equation}\label{fdtpsd}
x^2 (f)  = \frac{4k_B T}{(2 \pi f)^2}\; \Re[Y]
\end{equation}

Where $Y$ is the inverse of the impedance or admittance. With this power spectra, modelling and budgeting notable LIGO fundamental noise contributions attributed to the choice of the materials used for mirror substrates, and highly reflective mirror coatings becomes less daunting. Though adequate modelling of internal force couplings for the aforementioned components is required.

\subsubsection{Internal friction in Materials and Loss angle}

Zener provides a model of the internal friction of materials incorporating anelasticity into the equations of motion \cite{zener:1948}:

\begin{equation}
F = k(1+i\phi)x + m\ddot{x}
\end{equation}

Where $m$ is mass attached to a spring with a spring constant $k(1+ i\phi)$ incorporating the degree of anelasticity $\phi$. From equations 3.5 and 3.3 we perform a Laplace transform and acquire the following form of admittance:
\begin{equation}
Y(s) = \frac{\dot{x}(s)}{F(s)} = \frac{-s}{k(1+i\phi) + ms^2}
\end{equation}

\noindent Or more transparently the Fourier representation since we assume a linear time invariant system:

\begin{equation}\label{admitint}
Y(\omega) = \frac{\dot{x}(\omega)}{F(\omega)} = \frac{-i\omega}{k(1+i\phi) - m\omega^2} = \frac{k \omega \phi - i \omega (k - m \omega^2)}{(k-m\omega^2)^2 +k^2 \phi^2}
\end{equation}

\noindent Plugging equation \ref{admitint} back into \ref{fdtpsd}:

\begin{equation}
x^2 (f)  = \frac{2k_B T}{\pi}\frac{k\phi}{(k-4\pi^2 m f^2)^2 + k^2 \phi^2}
\end{equation}

\noindent Computing the admittance from a Gaussian beam impinging upon a HR mirror can require expansion of all individual mechanical degrees of freedom of the test mass system across a relevant frequency range, and with that approach convergence is not guaranteed. Saulson and Gonzalez provide an alternative method to computing the admittance coined the ``direct approach" by Levin when computing the noise from a Gaussian beam on a LIGO HR test mass. The admittance can be acquired through:

\begin{equation}\label{admitdirec}
\Re[Y] = \frac{W_\mathrm{diss}}{F_o^2}
\end{equation}

\noindent $W_\mathrm{diss}$ is the dissipated power from the system due to an oscillating force $F_o$. This form of the admittance reveals an important result of the fluctuation dissapation theorem where an undriven system with a dissapative actor, imparts motion to the degrees of freedom via a driving force by virtue of that same actor at finite temperatures. This direct approach also allows the surface pressure applied by the Gaussian beam to interrogate which mechanical modes of the test mass impose a significant energy when \ref{admitdirec} is plugged into \ref{fdtpsd}. In the case of the gaussian beam / uncoated test mass studied by Levin \cite{levin:1998}:

\begin{equation}
S_x(f) = \frac{4 k_B T}{f} \frac{1-\sigma^2}{\pi^3 E_o r_o} I\phi \bigg[1- O\bigg( \frac{r_o}{R} \bigg)\bigg]
\end{equation}

%this requires that the driving force used in a lab mimics that of a force from a centered Gaussian beam.

\textcolor{red}{Refer to Levin appendix for more on how elasticity parameters are introduced?} Where $\phi$ and $E_o$ are the Poisson ratio and Young's modulus respectively, and $O(\frac{r_o}{R})$ contains a correction term contribution as a function of the small beam radius ($r_o$) relative to the mirror radius ($R$).

\subsubsection{Coating Brownian thermal noise}
Further investigations into the beam/optic system utilizing this approach and elasticity theory led to a deeper understanding about Brownian thermal noise contributions from LIGO test masses (substrate, suspensions, HR coating). Levin mentions, with details from Harry, that the noise contributed by a lossy mirror coating is proven to be to be the most significant contributor of brownian thermal noise. Hong provides a power spectral density \cite{Hong:2013}:

\begin{equation}
S_j^X = \frac{4k_B T \lambda \phi_x^j(1- \sigma_j - 2 \sigma_j^2)}{3 \pi^2 f Y_j (1-\sigma_j)^2 \omega_o^2}
\end{equation}

Where X represents bulk and shear with j = odd (material 1) and j = even (material 2) alternating layers representing high and low index materials j = odd (material 1) j = even (material 2) for an HR coating.

\noindent Currently thermal noise from the $\mathrm{SiO_2}/\mathrm{TiO_2:Ta_2O_5}$ optical coatings is the largest contributor of Brownian noise in LIGO compared to estimated substrate and suspension thermal noise \cite{Harry:06}. As of the end of O3, Brownian thermal noise is estimated to be ? orders of magnitude below the current sensitivity and it will prove to be the limiting source of noise as that sensitivity is increased with various other upgrades mitigating fundamental and technical noise. (\textcolor{red}{already mentioned in intro prior to this thermal noise section. Need to re-iterate in more detail?})

\subsection{Anisotropic media and birefringence}
Unlike with isotropic media, we cannot assume that the index of refraction of anisotropic media is the same for all chosen wave vectors. This is a direct consequence of the birefringence of anisotropic media; characterized by the dielectric, permittivity, and polrization tensors. The relation between the displacement vector and electric field:

\begin{equation}
D_i = \varepsilon_{ij}E_j
\end{equation}
Where i=j for isotropic media.

\subsection{Analytical approximation}
Fejer and Bonilla take an analytical approximation approach when finding the impact of the electric field to the change in phase of the light through a crystalline anisotropic thin film ($\lambda/4$) stack \cite{bonilla_fejer}.

\begin{equation}
\hat{\phi}' = \frac{\pi n_1 z}{1-z^2}(z^{2N} -1) \frac{z^{2N} \frac{(n_f)^2}{n_2 n_3}(n_2 \kappa_{\gamma 2} + n_3\kappa_{\gamma 3}) - (n_2 \kappa_{\gamma 3} + n_3\kappa_{\gamma 3})}{(n_1)^2 -(n_f)^2 z^{4N}}
\end{equation}

with $z = \frac{n_2}{n_3}$
and
$
\kappa_{\gamma j} = \frac{d}{d \gamma} \mathrm{log}(n_j h_j)|_{\gamma =\gamma_{O}} \bigg(\frac{\hat{n}_j'}{\hat{n}_j} +\frac{\hat{h}_j'}{\hat{h}_j} \bigg)
$

With $\kappa$ being a scalar parameter.

\satoshi{Adding a schematic would be helpful.}

\textcolor{red}{Figure is in the works}

\subsection{Numerical estimate}

In the appendix of \cite{ballmer2015} Ballmer explains a formalism that allows the coating transfer function given a differential change in phase due to a scalar parameter to be expressed as follows:

\begin{equation}
M = Q_N D_N ...Q_kD_k...Q_1D_1Q_0
\end{equation}

For a single pass through the coating where the coating thickness and indices are left general.

\satoshi{Both approaches are essentially based on the same calculation method i.e., transfer matrices.}

\section{Projected DARM coupling}
To estimate how much DARM coupling can occur, we use use a measured field spectra acquired from installed electric field meters located within LIGO Hanford Observatory EX and EY vacuum chambers. Taking the upper and the lower EFM measurements in $.3\; [\mathrm{V}/\mathrm{m}/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}]}$ @ 60 Hz and $4\times10^{-3}\; [\mathrm{V}/\mathrm{m}/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}]}$ @ 4kHz ~\cite{efm_log}.
\satoshi{I don't think these values are calibrated. According to Martynov et al. 2016, the fluctuations in the electric filed is $\sim10^{-5}\,\mathrm{[(V/m)/\sqrt{Hz}]}$.}
This along with computed estimate above allows us to create an upper limit for what this noise might be assuming incoherent fields between the end stations and a flat frequency response within LIGO's bandwidth.

\section{Experiment}
To probe for this effect, we took the approach of an in-air Fabry-P\'{e}rot cavity with a GaAs/$\mathrm{Al_{.92}Ga_{.08}As}$ coated sample end mirror mounted in a custom designed MACOR mount with the ability to install electrodes maintaining a fixed distance from the sample surfaces for a controlled E-field injection. Details and specifications are discussed as well as relevant measurements. An improved experimental design is also detailed for a higher sensitivity measurement.

\subsection{Design}
This section details the Pound-Drever-Hall servo which is at the heart of this experiment, the on-table design, a sample / electrode assembly used for a controlled electric field injection, and electrode drive parameters
\subsubsection{PDH servo}
The Pound-Drever-Hall technique, originally imagined for laser frequency stabilization to an ultra-stable length reference, achieves constant resonance with said reference by tracking the phase of the cavity input light with respect to the light reflected from the cavity. Tracking the approximately linear phase response across resonance is at the heart of this technique and recognizes that physical property to be probed around a cavity's resonance cannot be the intensity of the transmitted or reflected light because of the quadratic symmetry. (\textcolor{red}{Derivative of the intensity could work but depends on us operating off resonance})
\\
\textcolor{red}{Insert figure of reflected intensity and phase response around resonance (cavity transfer function). Maybe also have a figure corresponding to what this could represent in a lab. (sweeping a mirror of the laser cavity through resonance)}
\\
Another novelty and insight to the technique is the use of phase modulation onto the carrier field which is the mathematical and physical equivalent to imposing separate optical fields which in most cases do not resonate in the optical cavity.
\\
\begin{equation}
E_\mathrm{inp} = E_o e^{i \omega t + \beta \mathrm{sin}( \Omega t)}
\end{equation}

\textcolor{red}{Approximation with Bessel functions (assumptions about modulation depth)}

E_\mathrm{inp} \approx E_o \satoshi{E_0} [J_o\satoshi{J_0}(\beta)e^{i \omega t} + J_1(\beta)e^{i (\omega + \Omega) t} - J_1(\beta)e^{i(\omega -\Omega)t}]
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Sample / Electrode assembly}
Maximizing the electric field ($|E_z|$) and within the coating while requiring a through beam to and through the HR coating lead us to imagine disk electrodes with a 3mm central aperture. The aperture size was chosen to be at least 5 times larger than the beam size at the plate locations. This was to avoid any beam clipping while still allowing to maximize the field strength at the region of interest.
\\
Most commercial optical mounts are conductive which proved to be a problem when attempting to find a mounting solution while reducing the non-normal field gradients within the volume of interest around the sample. Because of this, we chose to construct an optical mount made of MACOR a machinable ceramic with high a high Young's modulus (66.9 GPa), and a moderate Poisson ratio (.29) \cite{macor}. An optical mount for the sample made with MACOR, along with glass bearnings .48 $\pm$ .01 cm $\diameter$  and a McMaster-Carr 8-32, 1/2" ceramic screw were used to clamp and suspend the optical sample. A 1.24" $\diameter$ hole was bored into the MACOR with a (\textcolor{red}{depth?}) depth so that there is a ? mm clearance between the front and back surface of the sample to the electrode plates.

\subsection{$|E_z|$ strength estimate}
To convey the problem at hand, it is useful to review the illustration seen \textcolor{red}{here (figure showing the the electrode plates, and sample with AlGaAs coating}
\subsubsection{Math}
To find the Electric field screened by the coating we begin with Gauss' Law:

\begin{equation}
\nabla \cdot D = \rho_\mathrm{free}
\end{equation}

For our problem we assume no free charge, but the fused silica substrate with the AlGaAs coating presents dielectric material between the plates. Our initial boundary conditions are also expressed in terms of plate potentials so it is natural to first solve for the potential ($V$) for every point within our system. We can exploit the cylindrical symmetry with the optic and plate geometry in the $r$ coordinate so we shall express the Laplacian accordingly:
\begin{equation}
(1-\chi)\bigg[\frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial}{\partial r} \bigg( r \frac{\partial}{\partial r}\bigg) + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial z^2}\bigg]V = 0
\end{equation}
Where $\chi$ is a spatially dependent electric susceptibility. (\textcolor{red}{Establish coordinates for $\gaas$/$\algaas$, as well as the fused silica substrate so the computation is transparent})
\\
\satoshi{Definition of $\rho$ must be explained. $\rho$ and $\rho_{\mathrm{free}}$ are confusing.
Define $\chi$ and $V$.}

\noindent\textcolor{red}{I will change $\rho$ to $r$ am going to modify figure text so it matches soon.}

Utilizing this, we can proceed to a construction of a numerical Laplacian.

\section{Electro-optic measurement apparatus}\label{tanioka2022}
%In seeking a calibrated estimate of the electro-optic effect for the $\gaas$/$\algaas$ mirror coating stack, we sought to drive an electro-optic response of a mirror sample from Thorlab's crystalline mirror coatings division placed within a custom longitudinal Pockels cell mirror mount. The assembly, with the installed sample, assumed the end mirror position within a two mirror Fabry-P\'erot cavity, while resonance of a circulating Nd:YAG 1064nm carrier beam was held by a Pound-Drever-Hall servo. As seen in the prior section, the size of the imparted phase noise for currently existing gravitational wave detector configurations is estimated to be small but notable. Investigation through measurement of said effect requires detection methods with sufficient sensitivity for the differential phase noise imparted by the effect. Details and specifications of the detection schema are discussed along with relevant measurements and results. 

In order to experimetnally investigate the EO effect in $\gaas$ / $\algaas$ coatings, we developed an optical setup using a Fabry-P\'erot cavity. \autoref{fig:simpschema} shows the schematic of the experimental setup. Parameters of this setup are listed in \autoref{table:cav_params}. The Fabry-P\'erot cavity is composed of two high-reflectivity mirrors -- an amorphous coating front mirror and $\gaas$/$\algaas$ coating with the same composition used in \autoref{algaas_numericalestimate}, transferred to a planar super-polished fused silica substrate.

\label{fig:simpschema}
\end{figure}
 Measurability of the electro-optic effect is contingent upon two initial design criteria: the sensitivity of the optical plant to be implemented in the PDH servo, and the maximum achievable electric field strength along the beam axis ($|E_z|_\mathrm{max}$). Both are discussed in more detail in the following sections. 

\subsection{PDH servo}\label{subsubsec:pdh}
The Pound-Drever-Hall technique, originally and commonly used for laser frequency stabilization to an ultra-stable length reference, allows the tracking of the linear phase response of an input carrier field through cavity resonance. The servo fully realizes the ability of an optical cavity to act as a length / frequency discriminator \cite{pound_drever_hall:1983}:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:cavlf}
	\frac{\Delta f}{f} = -\frac{\Delta L}{L}
\end{equation}

\noindent The alternative side-of-fringe lock provides a linear response in intensity, which is adequate for some applications but with reduced sensitivity due to the required power reduction by operating off resonance. Measurements of phase are extracted through an optical heterodyne; the co-propogation of a separate (but phase-locked) optical field with a known frequency separation to the carrier reflected from the cavity input~\cite{black:pdh}. The PDH servo bypasses the need for a complicated phase-locked two laser configuration by imposing a phase modulation onto the carrier field via an electro-optic modulator (aka Pockels cell) mentioned in section \autoref{sec:EOM}. Setting a photodiode of area ($A_\mathrm{PD}$) in reflection of the cavity with a coefficient of $r_\mathrm{cav}(\omega,L)$, we measure the reflected power of the input field given by \autoref{eq:inpEOM}\;:

%If the modulation depth given by \ref{eq:inpEOM} is set such that $\beta < 1$ then the input field may be approximated in terms of the first two Bessel functions $J_0$, $J_1$:

%\begin{equation} \label{eq:EOM_trans_field}
%E_\mathrm{inp} \approx E_0 [J_0(\beta)e^{i \omega t} + J_1(\beta)e^{i (\omega + \Omega) t} - J_1(\beta)e^{i(\omega -\Omega)t}]
%\end{equation}
%
%With a high enough modulation frequency the terms given above can be far enough from the carrier frequency, so that the phase modulation onto the carrier field is mathematically and physically equivalent to imposing separate optical fields (sidebands) which in most cases do not resonate in the optical cavity of interest. 

\begin{equation}
 \begin{alignedat}{3}
    &P_\mathrm{refl} && \approx \frac{|E_\mathrm{refl}|^2}{A_\mathrm{PD}} && \\
    & &&\approx \frac{E_0^2}{A_\mathrm{PD}} && \bigg\{J_0^2 |r_\mathrm{cav}(\omega,L)|^2 + J_1^2(\beta)|r_\mathrm{cav}(\omega+\Omega,L)|^2 - J_1^2(\beta)|r_\mathrm{cav}(\omega-\Omega,L)|^2 +  \\
    & && && J_0J_1(\beta)\big[r_\mathrm{cav}\omega,L) r_\mathrm{cav}^*(\omega+\Omega,L)\big] - J_ 0J_1(\beta)\big[r_\mathrm{cav}(\omega,L)r_\mathrm{cav}^*(\omega-\Omega,L)\big]\bigg\}
  \end{alignedat}
\end{equation}

The two trailing terms in the above equation for $P_\mathrm{refl}$ generate a beat frequency term between the carrier and lower and upper sidebands. The magnitude and sign of these beat terms directly relate to the phase of the reflected carrier field and can be measured and transformed to the error signal seen in \autoref{fig:pdherr} using resonant electronics (tuned to a chosen sideband frequency) for amplification and a mixer for demodulation.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figs/ALGAAS/pdh_error.pdf}
	\caption{By imposing 25 MHz RF sidebands, a pair of reflected reference fields near carrier resonance are off cavity resonance while beating with the carrier and provide a linear response after demodulating the sideband power. With the introduction of high and low frequency sideband fields, their presence is also detected through the DCPDs and PDH error signal. Their separations from carrier resonance are equal in phase (length, and frequency)~\cite{Bond:2017}.}
\label{fig:pdherr}
\end{figure}

With this linearity and sensitivity at cavity resonance, implementation into PID feedback is the next task as any small detuning of the cavity can be registered as a drift from the loop's zero point and fed back to an actuator with an estimated calibration gain factor. When implemented into a low-noise design, this servo can also be used for a high sensitivity lock-in measurement; and with well characterized instrumentation, calibration of the induced differential phase of the light within the stable reference cavity into differential length (or frequency) ~\cite{black:pdh}.


\subsection{Servo Parameters}
The quantity we are attempting to measure is a differential length coupling on the order of $3.3 \times 10^{-18}$ [m/(V/m)], motivating a short cavity design as the relative differential length (phase) change scales with the sensitivity \autoref{eq:cavlf}. Considerations of the lab mirror inventory and mode matching critera lead us to two candidate plano-concave (ROC = 0.333m) HR IBS coated sample input couplers; one from CVI Melles-Griot and another from ATFilms. When paired with the plano-plano $\gaas$/$\algaas$  mirror from the Crystalline Mirror Solutions (CMS) division of Thorlabs, designed cavity length was 0.105 m.

The implemented servo design uses a light source from a Mephisto 2000 NE Nd:YAG laser with a 25 MHz phase modulation from a New Focus Model 4003 IR resonant phase modulator. As indicated in the figure above, the electronics chain can be decomposed into two primary filter components: $S(f)$ and $A(f)$. The following table provides a summary with relevant experiment parameters:

\end{table}

The laser frequency is locked to the cavity length using the aformentioned Pound-Derver-Hall technique. The extracted error signal is then filtered by the Sensing chain (S(f)) before being passed to the Actuation chain (A(f)). When the laser is locked to the in-air cavity, the fluctuations of the laser frequency ($\Delta f$) obey \autoref{eq:cavlf}. 

\subsubsection{Sensing S(f)}
Sensing electronics are composed of a single element photodiode mounted to a tranimpedance amplifier PCB, splitting photocurrent to DC and RF filter chains. The RF path is within the feedback electronics chain and constructed to boost the RF signal prior to being passed to a frequency stabilization servo (FSS) \footnote{FSS schema and transfer function \autoref{appendix:fss_tf}} where it is demodulated by mixing the 25 MHz oscillator phased with variable cable length. Once demodulated, the measured beat signal while sweeping through resonance generates the PDH error signal profile \footnote{As seen in \autoref{fig:pdherr}, and \autoref{appendix:laser_sweep}}.

The actuation portion of the loop amplifies the FSS output with a single I/O channel of the SVR 350-3 BIP High Voltage Amplifier \footnote{HVA transfer function \autoref{appendix:hva_tfs}} from Piezomechanik GmbH with a custom pomona box (elog 412) fed back to the input. The Mephisto 2220 laser cavity PZT actuator follows immediately after with a measured actuation factor of 1.7 [MHz] / [V].

\subsection{Longitudinal Pockels Cell mirror mount assembly}
Maximizing a controlled and well defined electric field ($|E_z|$) within the coating while requiring a through beam to and through the HR coating lead us to a design very similar to that of a longitudinal pockels cell. The most common assembly used for this study is comprised of two electrodes with a 3mm central aperture which is chosen to be at least 5 times larger than the beam size at the plate locations; to avoid significant beam clipping while maximizing field strength ($\mathrm{E}_\mathrm{z}$) at the coating region of interest. There is also a required plate separation of at least 1/4" accounting for the thickness of the optical sample. Considering these constraints, modelling the system and computing the estimated field strength screened by the coating is the next step towards building the assembly.

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ALGAAS/longitudinal_pockels_cell_raw_isometric.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{Concept image of the longitudinal Pockels cell assembly}
\label{fig:pckcellconcept}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Modeling}
The field screened by the coating can be computed from Gauss' Law:
\begin{equation}
\nabla \cdot D = \rho_\mathrm{free}
\end{equation}

\noindent There is no free charge within the region of interest ($\rho_\mathrm{free}=0$), though the optic fused silica substrate with the AlGaAs coating imposes dielectric material between the plates. Boundary conditions are expressed in terms of the differential plate potential $V$, so it is natural to first solve the potential ($V(\mathrm{r, z})$) for all relevant system coordinate points.  

\begin{equation}\label{eq:cyllap}
\nabla^2 V = 0
\end{equation}

\paragraph*{Boundary Conditions}

The figure is annotated with relevant parameters to build the numerical model: the finite thicknesses of the electrode plates ($t_{el}$) , radius of the aperture at the center of the disk ($r_{ap}$), radius of the disk ($r_d$),thickness of the optic ($t_{opt}$),and radius of the optic substrate ($r_{opt}$)}

\subparagraph*{Simulation Area Edges:}
$ z \; = \;\mathrm{z}_\mathrm{max} $ or  $r \; = \;\mathrm{r}_{max}$ or  $r \; = \;\mathrm{r}_{max}$ 
\\

\noindent For assured simulation convergence, an exponential falloff was applied to the simulation boundaries other than the (free) $\mathrm{r} = 0$ edge:

\begin{equation}
    \mathrm{Simulation \; Area \; Edges} \rightarrow A_o e^{(r+z)/r_o}
\end{equation}

Where $A_o$ is a characteristic voltage, and $r_o$ is a chosen characteristic distance. Though with the region of interest being at the coating surface, these edges are far enough away that a change in these characteristic values would cause a negligible difference to the resulting E-field estimate.

\paragraph*{Numerical Recipe (Finite Differencing)}

We exploit the chosen optic / disk symmetry about the polar angle ($\partial V / \partial \theta = 0$) and compute for the longitudinal ($z$) and radial ($r$) coordinates with the use of the appropriate Laplacian:

\begin{equation} 
\bigg[\frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial}{\partial r} \bigg( r \frac{\partial}{\partial r}\bigg) + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial z^2} \bigg](\varepsilon V) = 0
\end{equation}

Where $\varepsilon$ is the dielectric

Observing equation \autoref{eq:cyllap} we parse the non-zero expression into it's individual parts:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:cyllap_xpand}
    \bigg[\underbrace{\frac{\partial^2}{\partial z^2}}_\text{(c)} + \underbrace{\frac{\partial^2}{\partial r^2}}_\text{(b)}  + \underbrace{\frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial}{\partial r}}_\text{(a)}\bigg] (\varepsilon V) = 0
\end{equation}

\subparagraph*{Term (a)}

Starting with the first derivative, we use the central difference approximation:

\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial}{\partial r} \rightarrow \frac{f(r + h, z) - f(r - h, z )}{2h} \rightarrow \bigg[-\frac{1}{2} \quad  0  \quad \frac{1}{2} \bigg]
\end{equation}

\subparagraph*{Term (b)}

Second derivative approximation, we use the standard 2d laplace stencil

\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial}{\partial r^2} \rightarrow \frac{f(r+h, z) - 2 f(r, z) + f(r-h, z)}{h^2} \rightarrow \big[ 1 \quad -2 \quad 1 \big]
\end{equation}

\subparagraph*{Term (c)}
Equivalent to the second derivative approximation used above:

\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial}{\partial z^2} \rightarrow  \frac{f(r, z+h) - 2 f(r, z) + f(r, z-h)}{h^2} \rightarrow \big[ 1\quad -2 \quad 1 \big]
\end{equation}

To build the stencil terms at the boundaries, we look at the specialized finite difference condition @ $ r = 0 $, with the symmetry about $r=0$ allowing the application of a ghost point V(-h,z) = V(h,z) :

\begin{equation}\label{eq:first_deriv_V}
	\frac{\partial V}{\partial r} = 0 \rightarrow V(h, z) = V(-h,z)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:second_deriv_V}
	\frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial r^2} = \frac{2}{h}\bigg(\frac{V(h,z) -  V(0, z) }{h}\bigg) 
\end{equation}

\autoref{eq:first_deriv_V} alone does not define V(0,z), to establish the form of this point, we proceed to (Taylor) expand the function about it:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:taylor_V}
 V \approx V_0  + C_1 r +  C_2 r^{2} + \mathcal{O}(r^4) 
\end{equation}

Symmetry about the origin imposes an even function of $V$:  
$$ \frac{\partial V}{\partial r} \approx C_1 +  2 C_2 r  + \mathcal{O}(r^3) $$

\begin{equation}\label{eq:taylor_terma}
	\frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial V}{\partial r} \approx  2 C_2  + \mathcal{O}(r^2)
\end{equation}

Where $C_1 = 0$ to avoid a singular point.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:taylor_termb}
	\frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial r^2} \approx 2 C_2 + \mathcal{O}(r^2) 
\end{equation}

Substituting \autoref{eq:taylor_terma} and \autoref{eq:taylor_termb} back into equation \autoref{eq:cyllap_xpand} :
\begin{equation}
    \nabla^2 (\varepsilon V)= \frac{\partial^2}{\partial z^2} + 4 C_2 
\end{equation}

The radial portion of the operator $\nabla^2 V$ given \autoref{eq:taylor_V} and \autoref{eq:second_deriv_V}:

\begin{equation}
\bigg(\frac{r_0}{h} - \frac{2}{h^2} \bigg) C_1 + \bigg(\frac{r_h}{h} + \frac{2}{h^2} \bigg) C_2 h^2 = 4 C_2
\end{equation}

Where again, we found $C_1 = 0$:

$$
(r_h * h + 2) C_2 = 4 C_2
$$

\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
	r_h = 2 / h  \; , \\
	r_0 = -2 / h
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Instead be a little more explicit on how you extract the calibration number from that simulation. Touch on the fact that the answer is somewhat boundary condition-dependent, as we don't specify the B.C outside the hole.}

\subsection{Calibration}



The  Electric field coupling can be expressed as a measured voltage:
$$\mathrm{V} = \frac{1}{1 + \mathrm{G}} \cdot \mathrm{n}_\mathrm{laser} - \frac{\mathrm{G}}{1 + \mathrm{G}} \cdot \mathrm{C}  \cdot \mathrm{E} \cdot \mathrm{A}_{2} \cdot \mathrm{V}_\mathrm{in} - \frac{\mathrm{F} \cdot \mathrm{A}_1}{1 + \mathrm{G}} \cdot \mathrm{n}_\mathrm{S} - \frac{A_1}{1 + \mathrm{G}} \cdot \mathrm{n}_\mathrm{F}$$
With G representing the open loop gain ($\mathrm{G} = \mathrm{A}_1 \cdot \mathrm{F} \cdot \mathrm{S} \cdot \mathrm{L}$). The feedback signal can also be represented as:

	\begin{align*} \mathrm{V}_\mathrm{out} & = \mathrm{F} \cdot \mathrm{S} \cdot \mathrm{L} \cdot (\mathrm{V} + \mathrm{C} \cdot \mathrm{E} \cdot \mathrm{A}_{2} \cdot \mathrm{V}_\mathrm{in}) + \mathrm{F} \cdot \mathrm{n}_\mathrm{S} + \mathrm{n}_\mathrm{F} \\ & = \frac{\mathrm{F} \cdot \mathrm{S} \cdot \mathrm{L}}{ 1 + \mathrm{G}} \cdot \mathrm{C} \cdot \mathrm{E} \cdot \mathrm{A}_{2} \cdot \mathrm{V}_\mathrm{in} + \frac{\mathrm{F} \cdot \mathrm{S} \cdot \mathrm{L}}{ 1 + \mathrm{G}} \cdot \mathrm{n}_\mathrm{laser} + \frac{\mathrm{F} }{ 1 + \mathrm{G}}\cdot \mathrm{n}_\mathrm{S} +  \frac{1}{ 1 + \mathrm{G}} \cdot \mathrm{n}_\mathrm{F} \end{align*}
Therefore $\frac{\mathrm{V}_\mathrm{out}}{\mathrm{V}_\mathrm{in}}$ : 
$$ \frac{\mathrm{V}_\mathrm{out}}{\mathrm{V}_\mathrm{in}} = \frac{\mathrm{F} \cdot \mathrm{S} \cdot \mathrm{L}}{1 + \mathrm{G}} \cdot \mathrm{C} \cdot \mathrm{E} \cdot \mathrm{A}_{2}  + \frac{\mathrm{F} \cdot \mathrm{S} \cdot \mathrm{L}}{ 1 + \mathrm{G}} \cdot \frac{\mathrm{n}_\mathrm{laser}}{\mathrm{V}_\mathrm{in}}+ \frac{\mathrm{F} }{ 1 + \mathrm{G}} \cdot \frac{\mathrm{n}_\mathrm{S}}{\mathrm{V}_\mathrm{in}} +  \frac{1}{ 1 + \mathrm{G}} \cdot \frac{\mathrm{n}_\mathrm{F}}{\mathrm{V}_\mathrm{in}}$$
\swb{The above is not a transfer function. Either express $V_{in}$ as function of all inputs, or, if you want a true transfer function, set all  inputs except $V_{in}$ to 0, so only keet the first term in the above equation.}
If the induced excitation is larger than the noise  we approximate the last equation:

$$ \frac{\mathrm{V}_\mathrm{out}}{\mathrm{V_{in}}} \approx \frac{\mathrm{F} \cdot \mathrm{S} \cdot \mathrm{L}}{1 + \mathrm{G}} \cdot \mathrm{C} \cdot \mathrm{E} \cdot \mathrm{A}_{2} = \frac{\mathrm{G}}{1 + \mathrm{G}} \cdot \mathrm{C} \cdot \mathrm{E} \cdot \frac{\mathrm{A}_{2}}{\mathrm{A}_{1}} $$
 \swb{The second piece is not correct, singe G = A1*F*S*L.}

\subsubsection{OLG(f)}
\begin{figure}[H]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figs/ALGAAS/tfs/OLG.pdf}
    \caption{Measurement of the OLG taken as noted in \autoref{appendix:OLG_meas}}
  \end{center}
  \label{fig:OLGmeas}
\end{figure}

\swb{You need some context for this. What is this the OLG of?}

The calibration math for this measurement explicitly starts with what I
call \(\alpha(f)\) which is a vector of complex numbers that represents
the transfer function \(\mathrm{CH2}(f)/\mathrm{CH1}(f)\) where:

\[\mathrm{CH1}(f) = \mathrm{Source}(f)\] and
\[\mathrm{CH2}(f) = \frac{\mathrm{S}(f)* signal(f)}{1-\mathrm{OLG}(f)}\]

Where \[\mathrm{OLG}(f) = \mathrm{A}(f)* \mathrm{S}(f)\]

and \(signal(f)\) is the demodulated output from
\(\mathrm{RFPD}_\mathrm{refl}\) and \(\mathrm{S}(f)\) is the transfer
function of the frequency stabilization servo.

From here we solve for signal(f):

\[signal(f) = \mathrm{CH2}(f) * \mathrm{A}_{1}(f) * \mathrm{A}_2* \frac{(1-\mathrm{OLG}(f))}{\mathrm{OLG}(f)}\]

Where \(\mathrm{A}_{1}(f)\) informs the frequency dependent drive sent
to the laser PZT to keep the cavity locked and \(\mathrm{A}_2\) is the
laser frequency detuning factor {[}Hz/V{]} (can be estimated from
measuring PDH).

Currently \(signal(f)\) provides a frequency noise spectra which then
can be converted into a displacement spectra with the following
relation:

\[\frac{\Delta f}{f_\mathrm{laser}} = \frac{\Delta L}{L_\mathrm{cav}}\]

This allows us to imagine the frequency noise spectra as a length noise
spectra due to the drive on the electrodes:

\[signal(f) = \alpha(f)* \mathrm{Source}(f) * \mathrm{A}_{1}(f) * \mathrm{A}_2* \frac{(1-\mathrm{OLG}(f))}{\mathrm{OLG}(f)} * \frac{L_\mathrm{cav}}{f_\mathrm{laser}}\hspace{35pt} [m_\mathrm{pk}]\]

And for the measurement normalized by the drive voltage on the
electrodes:

\[\frac{signal(f)}{\mathrm{Source}(f) * \mathrm{G}(f)} = \frac{\alpha(f)}{\mathrm{G}(f)} * \mathrm{A}_{1}(f) * \mathrm{A}_2* \frac{(1-\mathrm{OLG}(f))}{\mathrm{OLG}(f)} * \frac{L_\mathrm{cav}}{f_\mathrm{laser}}\hspace{35pt} \bigg[\frac{m_\mathrm{pk}}{V_\mathrm{pk}}\bigg]\]
\#\# Noise or single frequency drive measurement : \(n(f)\) The
calibration math for this measurement is essentially equivalent to the
transfer function measurement above. The only difference is:

\[\mathrm{CH1}(f) = \frac{\mathrm{S}(f)* signal(f)}{1-\mathrm{OLG}(f)}\]

and

\[signal(f) = \mathrm{CH1}(f) * \mathrm{A}_{1}(f) * \mathrm{A}_2* \frac{(1-\mathrm{OLG}(f))}{\mathrm{OLG}(f)} * \frac{L_\mathrm{cav}}{f_\mathrm{laser}}\]

Where \(signal(f)\) in this measurement represents the free running
cavity displacement noise with the exception of a single frequency if it
is not a noise measurement.

If \(\mathrm{CH1}(f)\) is in \(\frac{V_\mathrm{rms}}{\sqrt{Hz}}\) then
signal(f) will be in \(\frac{m_\mathrm{rms}}{\sqrt{Hz}}\)

or

If \(\mathrm{CH1}(f)\) is in \(V_\mathrm{pk}\) then signal(f) will be in
\(m_\mathrm{pk}\)

\subsection{Assembly Mount Tests/Development}
The following section briefly discusses the nature of early measurements performed with various longitudinal pockel cell mount assemblies. Further details (assembly parameters, blueprints, and visual aids) can be found in the appendix. 

\subsubsection{Assembly 0 $\rightarrow$ Assembly 2}
A significant barrier to low differential length noise sensitivity for this experiment was the lack of low-noise optical mounts in accessible non-conductive materials. Most commercial optical mounts are constructed with conductive materials which is problematic when seeking to isolate the coating from non-normal field gradients within the coating volume of interest.  For this reason, efforts were focused on developing a suitable mounting solution that would provide adequate isolation from any uncontrolled field magnitudes while driving a field normally incident on the surface with enough strength and uniformity across the beam area to extract a measurement of the differential length change from the Pockels effect. 3D printing for this project was inititally used as a means to prototype optical mount designs but public health concerns at the time made testing with alternative materials aside from PLA and PETG difficult. There were multiple 3D prints tested within the optical schema depicted in \autoref{fig:simpschema}. Varying the mechanical configurations (i.e. differential electrode and / or optic set screw settings) to the slightest degree left us to discover a variety of drive couplings via excitations from the assembly sample-mount acoustic modes while driving the voltage on electrodes plates. Tracking consistent mechanical response for assemblies prior to Assembly 3 proved challenging due to inconsistent mechanical settings between some measurements and span different geometries / material properties \footnote{For more details see \autoref{appendix:mount_assemblies}}. An adequate solution was dependent on selecting a material and geometry that would generate narrow acoustic resonances while simultaneously achieving adequately low noise within a bandwidth of interest (a not so uncommon experimental technique, esp. for optic suspensions, that is frequently used and mentioned within collaboration literature). Assembly 3 demonstrated such characteristics and is discussed further.


\subsubsection{Assembly 3 (MACOR mount)}
To maintain the aforementioned \hyperlink{fig:laplacecoords}{boundary conditions} in situ, an optical mount made of MACOR, a machinable ceramic, was built and installed. With the material's high Young's modulus (66.9 GPa), and a moderate Poisson ratio (.29) \cite{macor} making it by far the most durable / non-conductive mounting solution tried.

An optical mount for the sample made with MACOR, along with spherical glass bearnings with a .48 $\pm$ .01 cm $\diameter$, and a McMaster-Carr 8-32, 1/2" ceramic screw were used to clamp the optical sample within a bored 25.74 $\pm$ .5 mm $\diameter$ barrel. Two 1.24" $\diameter$ holes were also bored at a 9 mm depth about the front and back side of the optical mount to accomodate for a flush fit of copper electrodes. The construction suggests a 1 $\pm$ .5 mm clearance between the front and back surface of the sample to the electrode plates.

\subsection{Measured birefringence from HR \texorpdfstring{$\gaas$}{gaas}/\texorpdfstring{$\algaas$}{algaas} mirror}

To identify the fast and slow axes, the crystalline HR mirror is temporarily paired with a highly reflective input mirror to form a high finesse cavity. The DC power in reflection of the cavity was probed while the laser frequency was linearly swept about resonance and various input laser polarizations sampled using a half waveplate ($\lambda$ / 2). The resulting measurements exhibit a split cavity resonance when the beam polarization is not co-aligned with one of the two eigenaxes set by the HR sample birefringence.

%%Is the measured birefringence static? (Layer bonding method might introduce something?)
%% Does it change from different mounting methods? (Photoelastic) (order of magnitude estimate)
%% Electro-optic ruled out based on field measurements and relative coupling factor.
%% Measurement precision of the coating birefringence? Cavity length, Polarization drifts, etc.
From coating manufacturers it's estimated that static birefringence can arise from the intrinsic strain between hetero-epitaxial layers of $\gaas$/$\algaas$. \cite{cole:2013, adachi:1985}

\section{Results}
\subsection{Acousto-optical noise}
A significant barrier to low differential length noise sensitivity for this experiment is the lack of low-noise optical mounts in accessible non-conductive materials. Most commercial optical mounts are constructed with conductive materials which proves problematic when seeking to isolate the coating from non-normal field gradients within the coating volume of interest. For this reason, there were multiple efforts were focused on developing a suitable mounting solution that would provide adequate isolation from any uncontrolled field magnitudes while driving a field normally incident on the surface with enough strength and uniformity across the beam area to extract a measurement of the differential length change from the Pockels effect. Varying the mechanical configurations (i.e. differential electrode and / or optic set screw settings) to the slightest degree left us to discover a variety of drive couplings via excitations from the assembly sample-mount acoustic modes driving the voltage on electrodes plates. Tracking consistent mechanical response for assemblies prior to Assembly 3 proved challenging due to inconsistent mechanical settings between some measurements and span different geometries / material properties \footnote{For more details see \autoref{appendix:mount_assemblies}}. An adequate solution was dependent on selecting a material and geometry that would generate narrow acoustic resonances while simultaneously achieving adequately low noise within a bandwidth of interest (a not so uncommon experimental principle that is heavily used and mentioned within collaboration literature). The associated configuration \footnote{Assembly 3 : \autoref{fig:assembly3}} provided such a solution and the driven acoustic modes (\textless 10 kHz \& 40kHz - 80kHz) were confirmed when comparing the cavity response between $\gaas$/$\algaas$ coating and the non-crystalline HR coating from ATFilms \footnote{A null measurement reference} with additional confirmation from finite element analysis.  From here, an upper threshold noise estimate of the electro-optic coupling is extracted by taking the difference between fast and slow axes:


\[ 
    \begin{aligned}
	\mathrm{diff} & = C_\mathrm{slow} - C_\mathrm{fast} \\
		      & = (C_\mathrm{m, slow} + C_\mathrm{EO, slow}) - (C_\mathrm{m, fast} + C_\mathrm{EO, fast}) \\
		      & =  2 |C_\mathrm{EO}| e^{i \psi}
    \end{aligned}
\]

\subsection{EO coupling estimate}

    \label{fig:final_tf_conversion}
\end{figure}


From this experiment an upper threshold estimate between 20 kHz - 40 kHz is $\approx \; 6.5 \times 10^{-17} \; [\mathrm{m}]/[\mathrm{V}/\mathrm{m}]$ \iffalse $\approx \; 1.1 \times 10^{-17} \; [\mathrm{m}]/[\mathrm{V}/\mathrm{m}]$ \fi though at higher frequency, frequency dispersion of the electro-optic coefficients may explain the increase.  The uniform flat response is extended to frequencies at which LIGO operates 10 Hz - 1 kHz as prior work has demonstrated such a trend from 10 Hz to several 10s of kHz ~\cite{salvestrini:2003}.

The significantly improved thermal noise performance of $\gaas$/$\algaas$ HR coatings make these crystalline coatings a prime candidate for the core optics in current and future gravitational wave detectors. The measured upper threshold of the electro-optic noise is demonstrated to be $\sim 10^{-26} \; [1/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}]$ two orders of magnitude below the designed noise floor $\sim 10^{-24}\; [1/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}]$ of current and future gravitational wave detectors.

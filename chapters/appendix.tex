\section{Calibration math for Electro-optic effect}
The frequency response measurement shown in (?) records the following transfer function in dB of the following:

$$\alpha(f) = \frac{CH2(f)}{Source}$$

Channel

We also know that the error signal spectra of the loop is probed by $CH2(f)$:


$$ CH2(f) = \frac{\mathrm{S}(f)*signal_V}{(1-\mathrm{OLG}(f))}$$

Where $signal_V$ is the uncalibrated voltage output from the mixer, $\mathrm{S}(f)$ is the FSS transfer function, and $\mathrm{OLG}(f)$ is the open loop gain of the PDH system.

\section{Gravitational waves}
``Space-time tells mass how to move; mass tells space-time how to curve" can provide a concise and sufficient summarization of Einstein's theory of general relativity (GR) ~\cite{Misner1973}. While providing the most complete theory of gravity to date, GR provides tools containing considerations of high energy astrophyical phenomena (highly massive binary coalescences, spherically assymetric compact objects, etc.) whose fractional mass/energy output generates distortions in space-time known as gravitational waves. 
This is represented as a perturbation ($|h_{\mu \nu}|<<1$) in the Minkowski metric tensor defining a local linearized space-time:
\\
$$g_{\mu \nu} = \eta_{\mu \nu} + h_{\mu \nu}$$
\\
Wave-like behavior for $h_{\mu \nu}$ is realized after imposing the Lorentz gauge; producing 10 harmonic wave amplitudes from the Einstein field equations. By further imposing a wave vector ($k_j$) onto one of three linearly independent spatial coordinates ($h^{ij}k_j$), the non-trivial amplitudes from the equations imply a transverse and traceless ($h^{i}_{i}$) gauge:
\\
$$\nabla^2 h_{+} - \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial}{\partial t} h_{+} = 0$$
$$\nabla^2 h_{\times} - \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial}{\partial t} h_{\times} = 0$$
\\
In other words, there exists a wave solution with two separate transverse polarizations $h_{+}$ and $h_{\times}$ with a $45^{\circ}$ separation between them. Measurement and analysis of these waves allow astronomers to extract novel information related to the progenitors through testing various hypotheses pertaining to the violent dynamics of these systems. On September 14th, 2015 the first confirmed gravitational wave detection was made from a coalescing black hole pair 1.3 billion light years away, and since the first detection, other detectors (Virgo, KAGRA, etc.) have joined the GW detector network; continuing the search for novel events new catalogue of astronomical data; by providing further insight on multi-messenger events ~\cite{gw170817} and new observations of more exotic systems ~\cite{Nitz_2023}.

\section{Detector configurations}
Motivation for the current ALIGO experimental schema frankly cannot be taken for granted by the author; with a high number of subsystems it can be easy to get lost working within specialized observatory operations. The goal of this section is to compile a brief narrative and with the hopes of developing a holistic view of the LIGO detection schema. The various detector configurations start with the michelson interferometer and end at the dual-recycled Fabry-Perot Michelson interferometer. The narrative here is kept as brief as possible so to only mention that which is necessary and provide further udnerstanding and context of the main body of this work. Alongside the discussion are supplementary resources cited that provide exceptional alternative and detailed descriptions of the ALIGO detectors. 

\subsection{Interferometry with a Michelson configuration}
Initially used by Michelson and Morley to test for the existence of luminiferous aether, the schema of the Michelson interferometer and detection methodology demonstrate extraordinary potential for measuring gravitational wave amplitudes generated from the time varying quadrapole moment from an astrophysical source; making it a prime candidate as a gravitational wave detector / observatory. Two perpendicular beam paths are formed at a 50/50 beamsplitter, back-reflected from carefully placed end mirrors which are made to interfere back at the beam splitter disrupted by differential path length changes between the beam paths and tracked at the (anti-symmetric) detection port:

\begin{equation}\label{P_MICH_AS}
	P_\mathrm{out} = \frac{P_\mathrm{in}}{2} \bigg[1+\mathrm{cos}\Big(\frac{4\pi}{\lambda} (L_x - L_y)\Big) \bigg]
\end{equation}

The Michelson detects microsocopic differential length changes on a sub-wavelength order of magnitude and are more appropriately discussed as changes in differential phase ($\phi(t)$) between the returning perpendicular phasefronts ($\phi_x(t)$, $\phi_y(t)$). Understanding this inherent method of detection, a time-dependent metric perturbation ($h(t)$), like that generated from a gravitational wave, is tested on a Michelson interferometer with a nominal arm length of L and a laser with optical angular frequency of $\Omega$:

\begin{equation}
\Delta \phi(t) = \phi_x(t) - \phi_y(t) =  \int_{t-2L/c}^{t} \Omega \bigg[1 + \frac{1}{2}h(t)\bigg]dt - \int_{t-2L/c}^{t} \Omega \bigg[1 - \frac{1}{2}h(t)\bigg]dt 
\end{equation}

Evaluating the above as a function of frequency yields:

\begin{equation}\label{MICH_del_phi}
	\Delta \phi (\omega) = h_0\frac{2 L \Omega}{c}e^{-i L \omega / c} \frac{\mathrm{sin}(L \omega /c)}{L \omega /c} = h_0 \cdot H(\omega, \phi_0)
\end{equation}

With the wave amplitude $h_0$, angular frequency $\omega$, nominal interferometer arm length $L$, speed of light $c$, and optical angular frequency $\Omega$.

The differential phase \ref{MICH_del_phi} combine with the power at the anti-symmetric port \ref{P_MICH_AS} provides a function of optical gain, dependent on freqency and a differential offset phase ($\phi_0$):

\begin{equation}
	\Delta P(\omega, \phi_0) = h_0 \frac{P_\mathrm{in}}{2} \Delta \phi (\omega) \cdot \mathrm{sin}(\phi_0)
\end{equation}

\FloatBarrier

Assuming a 4km arm configuration with 25 Watts input power as indicated in figure \ref{MICH_del_phi} the differential arm response provides a reasonable optical gain with the notches coorelating to an integer number of gravitational wave half periods $\mathrm{n}\lambda_{gw} / 2$ to the interferometer arm length in such a way that the response is null. Though with an initial goal of detecting neutron star binaries @ 100 Hz it remains to be insufficient with a basic Michelson alone and enhancements are deemed necessary.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Fabry-P\'{e}rot Michelson (FPMI)}
With a minimum strain sensitivity of $10^{-18} \; [\frac{1}{\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}}]$~\cite{}, the simple Michelson interferometer does not provide sufficient optical gain for any practical arm length; and at the time of the LIGO proposal, constraints (both financial and physical) for terrestrial gravitational wave detectors required a compact solution for increasing length L of the Michelson arms so to increase the beam phasefront lifetime within the Michelson arms. Two proposed arm folding techniques were considered: the Herriot Delay Line and the Fabry-P\'{e}rot cavity. Though ultimately the Fabry-P\'{e}rot cavity has become the prominent choice.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{INTRO/HDL.pdf}
	\caption{\textcolor{red}{Figure of a Herriot Delay Line}}
	\label{fig:hdl_cav}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{The Fabry-P\'{e}rot cavity}
\label{section:FPC}
To understand the relevancy of the Fabry-P\'{e}rot, we consider an an idealized coherent light wave encountering an optical cavity with input and output mirror transmission and reflection coefficients of $t_1$, $r_1$ and $t_2$, $r_2$ respectively (and lossless mirrors $l=0$).

\begin{figure}[ht!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{INTRO/FP_cav.pdf}
	\caption{Figure of a Fabry Perot Cavity. \texcolor{red}{Add HR surface to ITM and ETM. With a faint transmission beam to the more deliberately labeled transmission photodiode}}
	\label{fig:fp_cav}
\end{figure}


Light enters the cavity only after passing the input mirror with a field amplitude reduced by the mirror reflection coefficient. So far this doesn't seem quite useful as we have already reduced the power for every entering phasefront. But a parallel realization can be made: that every phasefront admitted stays stored within the cavity until its final photon exits the cavity. This ``cavity storage time" ($\tau_s \appropto L r_1r_2$) is imagined as length elongation with the phasefront travel history encoded in the arrival time of its photons back at the beam splitter. But these benefits cannot be fully realized nor measured without the cost of achieving the cavity resonance condition: requiring coherent addition of the circulating phasefronts and demanding the cavity length be an integer number of wavelengths. A cavity of length $L$ and comprised of an input coupler ($r_1$,$t_1$) and end mirror ($r_2$, $t_2$) yield the following reflection and transmission coefficients: 

\iffalse that the input and circulating that the photons belonging to a particular phasefront can be experimentally tracked, and lucky for us this is is why we measure interference at the anti-symmetric port. But these benefit
 with a constant source at the cavity input the phasefronts entering the cavity are superimposed onto the circulating cavity field and, more often than not, add incoherently which can makes this thought experiment seem silly.\fi 

\begin{equation}
	r_c = -r_1 + \frac{t^2_1r_2 e^{-i2kL}}{1-r_1 r_2 e^{-i2kl}}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
	t_c = \frac{t_1 t_2 e^{-ikL}}{1-r_1 r_2 e^{-i2kL}}	
\end{equation}

It is with the careful microscopic tuning and maintanence of the mirror positions that creates the coherent addition of these intra-cavity phasefronts and the utility of the Fabry-P\'{e}rot can be fully realized. 

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ALGAAS/REFL_cav_intensity.pdf}
\caption{Reflected cavity intensity (I$_\mathrm{REFL}$) around resonance. The resonance peak full width half maximum is set by mirror reflectivities quantified by cavity finesse ($\mathscr{F} = \frac{\mathrm{FWHM}_\mathrm{res}}{f_\mathrm{FSR}} = \frac{\pi \sqrt{r_1 r_2}}{1-r_1 r_2}$).}
\label{fig:cav_length_response_DCpow}
\end{figure}

An analogue to the delay line storage time can be used to draw out further intuition of the effective ''arm elongation"~\cite{saulson2017}:

\begin{equation}
	\tau_s = \frac{L}{c} \frac{r_1r_2}{1-r_1r_2} = \frac{1}{4 \pi \mathscr{F}}
\end{equation}

And as shown with \ref{?} the increased arm length cooresponds to a higher optical gain to the Michelson's differential degree of freedom. 

\begin{equation}
	\mathrm{H_{FPMI}} = \frac{t_1 ^2 r_2}{(t_1^2 + r_1^2)r_2 - r_1} \frac{\mathrm{H_{MICH}}}{1 - r_1 r_2 e^{-2i \omega L / c}}
\end{equation}

Advanced LIGO, with it's length 4km and projected finesse of ? coorelates to a storage time of ?.
It's curious how theoretically only a laser and two mirrors with empty space between them can provide such an enhancement to measuring differential phase; though in practice this does not go without the nuiance of maintaining fixed mirror positions within a fraction of the wavelength of the light used. In spite of this, clever experimental techniques like the Pound-Drever-Hall technique allow experimentalists to achieve cavity perturbation measurements with high precision~\cite{?}. 

\subsection{Dual-Recycled Fabry-Perot Michelson (DRFPMI)}
Recycling mirrors are an extension of the FPMI that exploit otherwise wasted optical power by providing a means of enhancing the optical gain and bandwidth of the instrument. Strategic tuning of mirror coating parameters and positions at symmetric and anti-symmetric ports can incorporate power recycling and signal recycling respectively.

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth,page=4]{INTRO/ifo_configs.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{The Dual-Recycled Fabry-Perot Michelson optical schema}
\label{fig:drfp_michelson}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Power Recycling}
When operating a FPMI at a dark fringe, a significant amount of power is reflected back to the symmetric port as mentioned in~\ref{section:FPC} leading to the consistent waste of optical power if simply dumped. Placing an additional highly reflective mirror at the symmetric port and while maintaining resonance of the carrier to the arms, you can recirculate (or ``recycle") power back to the arm cavities. A PDH loop is utilized for carrier resonance, and the Power Recycling mirror macroscopic positioning is informed when considering optical sideband frequencies required when applying PDH. 

\begin{equation}
	\mathrm{G_{PR}} = \frac{(1-r_\mathrm{PRM}^2)}{1-r_\mathrm{PRM}[1- (\mathscr{F} \mathscr{L}_\mathrm{RT})/ \pi]}
\end{equation}

With a maximum recycling gain \ref{}: 

\begin{equation}
	\mathrm{G_{PR}} = \frac{\pi}{2 \mathscr{F} \mathscr{L}_\mathrm{RT}} \bigg[ \frac{1}{1- \frac{ \mathscr{F} \mathscr{L}_\mathrm{RT}}{ 2 \pi}} \bigg]
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Signal Recycling}
As may be implied, the technique requires a mirror installation at the anti-symmetric port; though with a more nuianced approach than that of power recycling. By simply placing a partially reflective mirror at the output port it is understood that light leakage coming from the PRFPMI at the anti-symmetric port (caused by differential arm motion) is re-introduced to the arms. The signal recycling mirror reflectivity cannot be set too high to avoid attenuation to the PRFPMI output. Though the detector enhancement only comes after exacting the cost of trading off the detector bandwidth for increased detector gain and vice versa. The operating point between the maxima of these two detection characteristics is a function of the microscopic length (phase) tuning:

\begin{equation}
	\mathrm{H}_\mathrm{DRFPMI} = \mathrm{G}_\mathrm{PR} \mathrm{P}_\mathrm{in} L \Omega \bigg[ \frac{ t_\mathrm{ITM}^2 r_\mathrm{ETM}}{(t_\mathrm{ITM}^2 + r_\mathrm{ITM}^2)r_\mathrm{ETM} - r_\mathrm{ITM}}  t_\mathrm{SRC} \frac{e^{-i 2 \pi L f / c} \mathrm{sin}( 2 \pi f / c)}{ 2 \pi L f } \frac{\mathrm{sin}(\phi_0)}{1- r_\mathrm{SRC}r_\mathrm{ETM} e^{-i 4 \pi L f / c}} \bigg]
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\begin{align}
	t_\mathm{SRC} & = \frac{t_\mathrm{SRM} t_\mathrm{ITM} e^{i\phi_\mathrm{SRC}}}{1-r_\mathrm{ITM} r_\mathrm{SRM} e^{i2\phi_\mathrm{SRC}}}, \\
	r_\mathrm{SRC} & = \frac{r_\mathrm{ITM} - r_\mathrm{SRM} e^{i2\phi_\mathrm{SRC}}}{1-r_\mathrm{ITM} r_\mathrm{SRM} e^{i2\phi_\mathrm{SRC}}} \\
\end{align}
\end{equation}

\end{figure}

``Core optics" (Recycling mirrors, Beam splitter, and FP arm cavity mirrors) are suspended with quadruple pendulum suspensions decoupling seismic activity from the mirror positions to as low as a frequency as possible. 

\subsection{Reaching ``Observing Mode"}
The requirements for the operation of this ultra sensitive displacement sensor require that the interferometer be  ``locked"; meaning that there are required configurations / criteria in order for the instrument to act as an observatory with the designed sensitivity. The objective at hand is to convey to the reader some of the essential criteria for interferometer operations as it pertains to this dissertation. As can be imagined with any highly coupled cavity configuration, length and alignment stabilization as well as mode matching are essential. The first order requirements of the interferometer

\subsubsection{Length Stabilization}
With LIGO's coupled cavity configuration, maintaining mirror positions is imperative. Techniques such as the offset lock (using a DC photodiode to measure the transmitted, reflected, or circulating power within a linear and slightly off resonance point) \cite{} and the Pound-Drever-Hall technique (see \ref{subsubsec:pdh} ) are used to maintain cavity length stabilization. Stabilizing cavity lengths to configure the detector into a highly sensitive differential arm sensor is a process that is worthwhile understanding with more ample discussions ~\cite{Mullavey:12}.

\subsubsection{Gaussian Beams}
So far, we've discussed light and phase fronts without addressing geometric constraints when using Gaussian laser light. We consider a general complex Gaussian beam mode propogating along the beam axis ($z$) with wavelength $\lambda$.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:gaussian_beam}
E(r) = E_o \frac{\sqrt{[\lambda z_o] / \pi}}{W(z)}e^{-r^2 / W^2(z)} e^{-ikz - ik[r^2 / (2R(z))] + i \zeta}
\end{equation}

Where $E_o$ is a complex amplitude, $r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$ defines the transverse beam coordinates, $k$ is the wave number, $W(z)$ is the beam width, $R(z)$ is the beam radius of curvature, and $\zeta$ is the Gouy phase.

Derived from the paraxial approximation of the Helmholtz equation, this field is not the only solution for optical cavities. Alternative higher order mode (HOM) solutions are commonly present and are expressed in terms of two mathematical bases: the Hermite-Gauss and Laguerre-Gauss modes. These HOMs are more often than not power parasites when attempting to only sense displacement Fabry-P\'{e}rot cavities and are a symptom of altered cavity geometry; though a virtue of the lost power is its utility as an error signal for sensing and actuation schemes. This is what is what is accomplished with an alignment sensing and control (ASC) system and a thermal compensation system (TCS) for mode matching actuation.

\textcolor{red}{FIGURE: ALIGO Sensor and Actuation schema?}

\subsubsection{Alignment sensing and control}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{ALGAAS/aligo_nb_plus_cbn.pdf}
    \end{center}
    \caption{A misaligned Fabry-P\'{e}rot cavity scatters circulating light into higher order Hermite-Gauss modes.}
\label{fig:aligo_tn_comparison}
\end{figure}

\begin{equation}
	E_{n,m}(x,y,z) = E_o \bigg[ \frac{W_o}{W(z)} \bigg] H_n \bigg[ \frac{\sqrt{2}x}{W(z)} \bigg] H_m \bigg[ \frac{\sqrt{2}x}{W(z)} \bigg] e^{-(x^2 + y^2)/W(z) - ikz - ik[(x^2 + y^2)/(2R(z))] + i(n + m + 1)\zeta(z)}
\end{equation}

Even with state-of-the-art ground motion isolation for terrestrial gravitational detectors using quadruple stage pendulums and high mass mirrors, current gravitational wave detectors still suffer from occasional misalignment and require sensing and feedback loops to meet mirror alignment requirements.

\subsubsection{Mode Matching}
For Gaussian beams, there are further requirements of macroscopic mirror positions and radius of curvatures to maximize resonant power in the fundamental (TEM00) mode. Failure to plan and maintain these conditions sucessfully results in a mismatch of the beam mode to the cavity mode, scattering power into higher order Laguerre-Gauss modes.  

\begin{equation}
	E_{n,m}(\rho, \phi, z) =  E_o \bigg[ \frac{W_o}{W(z)} \bigg] H_n \bigg[ \frac{\rho}{W(z)} \bigg]^2 L^n_m \bigg[ \frac{\sqrt{2}\rho^2}{W^2(z)} \bigg] e^{-\rho^2/W(z) - ikz - ik[\rho^2/(2R(z))] - jn \phi + i(n + 2m + 1)\zeta(z)}
\end{equation}

Even with ultra-low absorption HR mirror coatings and fused silica substrates, circulating power is estimated to reach $\geq$ 200 kW, distorting the radius of curvatures of the arm cavity mirrors by ? m; which can introduce significant optical loss due to mode mismatch (esp. for coupled cavities). And as a DRFPMI like aLIGO approaches designed sensitivity, instances of mode mismatch can be a two-fold threat with optical loss to higher order modes also impacting the ability to produced squeezed light states~\cite{}. The solution implemented in aLIGO as of O3 to sense mode mismatch consists of hartmann wavefront sensors (HWS) with 800 nm and 833 nm probe beams providing real-time mirror lensing / surface distortion data while actuation comes in the form of induced thermal actuation on mirrors throughout the interferometers with particular focus on the arm cavity mirrors. The thermal actuation of the core optics comes in two varieties: a CO2 laser actuator impinging upon a pre-installed fused silica compensation plate (CP) for positive lens actuation and an annular ring heater for negative lens actuation \cite{}.

\section{Detector Noise}

\section{Coating Thermal Noise}
Contributions of categorized noises for gravitational wave detectors are organized in a ''noise budget", comprised of a collection of technical (noise imposed by the practical operation of the detector) and fundamental (inherent physical limitations of DRFPMIs by design) noise sources that impose limitations on gravitational wave detection.
\textcolor{red}{Contributions of categorized noises for gravitational wave detectors the ''noise budget" ((LHO and LLO O3?) or just GWINC?)}

\subsection{Brownian Thermal Noise}
\textcolor{red}{Might move this section back to the $\algaas$ Electro-optic noise chapter}
\\
In 1827 the Scottish botanist Robert Brown noticed a constant motion of pollen particulates on the surface of water; witnessing randomized collisions of the water molecules holding a kinetic energy proportional to the temperature ($k_BT$) \cite{Brown:1828}. It is because of his documented observations we name the phenomena Brownian motion. And although the observations were on motion of particulates in liquids, molecules and atoms within gases and solids also exhibit Brownian motion. For high precision optical experiments operating at room temperature (and higher due to high power resonant beams), understanding how much differential phase noise is imparted on the interferometer light passing through and reflecting from core optics is crucial. This requires knowledge of the mean squared displacement from each degree of freedom of the system which can be realized through the Fluctuation Dissapation theorem. Derived by H.B. Callen and T.A. Welton, the theorem states that for a randomly fluctuating linear force \cite{Callen:1951}:

 %% Further insight into Brownian motion was explored by Einstein where he was able to relate the mean-square displacement of a particle of radius $r_\mathrm{sph}$ on a fluid with viscosity $\eta$.

 %%\begin{equation}
 %%\overline{x^2} = k_B T  \frac{1}{3 \pi \eta  r_\mathrm{sph}}
 %%\end{equation}

 %%This relation has important implications about how the random motion or fluctuations of a particulate (the pollen) is influenced (dissipated) by the viscosity of the surrounding medium (water).

\begin{equation}
F_x^2(f) = 4 k_B T\; \Re[Z]
\end{equation}

 \noindent Where $\Re[Z]$ is the real part of the impedance of the system. This impedance directly relates to equations of motion:

 \begin{equation}
 Z = \frac{F}{\dot{x}}
 \end{equation}

\noindent Another useful form is the power spectrum of the fluctuating motion:
\begin{equation}\label{fdtpsd}
x^2 (f)  = \frac{4k_B T}{(2 \pi f)^2}\; \Re[Y]
\end{equation}

Where $Y$ is the inverse of the impedance or admittance. With this power spectra, modelling and budgeting notable LIGO fundamental noise contributions attributed to the choice of the materials used for mirror substrates, and highly reflective mirror coatings becomes less daunting. Though adequate modelling of internal force couplings for the aforementioned components is required.

\subsubsection{Internal friction in Materials and Loss angle}

Zener provides a model of the internal friction of materials incorporating anelasticity into the equations of motion \cite{zener:1948}:

\begin{equation}
F = k(1+i\phi)x + m\ddot{x}
\end{equation}

Where $m$ is mass attached to a spring with a spring constant $k(1+ i\phi)$ incorporating the degree of anelasticity $\phi$. From equations 3.5 and 3.3 we perform a Laplace transform and acquire the following form of admittance:
\begin{equation}
Y(s) = \frac{\dot{x}(s)}{F(s)} = \frac{-s}{k(1+i\phi) + ms^2}
\end{equation}

\noindent Or more transparently the Fourier representation since we assume a linear time invariant system:

\begin{equation}\label{admitint}
Y(\omega) = \frac{\dot{x}(\omega)}{F(\omega)} = \frac{-i\omega}{k(1+i\phi) - m\omega^2} = \frac{k \omega \phi - i \omega (k - m \omega^2)}{(k-m\omega^2)^2 +k^2 \phi^2}
\end{equation}

\noindent Plugging equation \ref{admitint} back into \ref{fdtpsd}:

\begin{equation}
x^2 (f)  = \frac{2k_B T}{\pi}\frac{k\phi}{(k-4\pi^2 m f^2)^2 + k^2 \phi^2}
\end{equation}
Computing the admittance from a Gaussian beam impinging upon a HR mirror can require expansion of all individual mechanical degrees of freedom of the test mass system across a relevant frequency range, and with that approach convergence is not guaranteed. Saulson and Gonzalez provide an alternative method to computing the admittance coined the ``direct approach" by Levin when computing the noise from a Gaussian beam on a LIGO HR test mass. The admittance can be acquired through:

\begin{equation}\label{admitdirec}
\Re[Y] = \frac{W_\mathrm{diss}}{F_o^2}
\end{equation}

\noindent $W_\mathrm{diss}$ is the dissipated power from the system due to an oscillating force $F_o$. This form of the admittance reveals an important result of the fluctuation dissapation theorem where an undriven system with a dissapative actor, imparts motion to the degrees of freedom via a driving force by virtue of that same actor at finite temperatures. This direct approach also allows the surface pressure applied by the Gaussian beam to interrogate which mechanical modes of the test mass impose a significant energy when \ref{admitdirec} is plugged into \ref{fdtpsd}. In the case of the gaussian beam / uncoated test mass studied by Levin \cite{levin:1998}:

\begin{equation}
S_x(f) = \frac{4 k_B T}{f} \frac{1-\sigma^2}{\pi^3 E_o r_o} I\phi \bigg[1- O\bigg( \frac{r_o}{R} \bigg)\bigg]
\end{equation}

%this requires that the driving force used in a lab mimics that of a force from a centered Gaussian beam.

\textcolor{red}{Refer to Levin appendix for more on how elasticity parameters are introduced?} Where $\phi$ and $E_o$ are the Poisson ratio and Young's modulus respectively, and $O(\frac{r_o}{R})$ contains a correction term contribution as a function of the small beam radius ($r_o$) relative to the mirror radius ($R$).

\subsubsection{Coating Brownian thermal noise}
Further investigations into the beam/optic system utilizing this approach and elasticity theory led to a deeper understanding about Brownian thermal noise contributions from LIGO test masses (substrate, suspensions, HR coating). Levin mentions, with details from Harry, that the noise contributed by a lossy mirror coating is proven to be to be the most significant contributor of brownian thermal noise. Hong provides a power spectral density \cite{Hong:2013}:

\begin{equation}
S_j^X = \frac{4k_B T \lambda \phi_x^j(1- \sigma_j - 2 \sigma_j^2)}{3 \pi^2 f Y_j (1-\sigma_j)^2 \omega_o^2}
\end{equation}

Where X represents bulk and shear with j = odd (material 1) and j = even (material 2) alternating layers representing high and low index materials j = odd (material 1) j = even (material 2) for an HR coating.

\textcolor{red}{Insert computed curves of the most precise and recent (effective) loss angle measurements (Nick Demos measurements?). More instructive to plot strain spectral density or displacement power spectra}

\noindent Currently thermal noise from the $\mathrm{SiO_2}/\mathrm{TiO_2:Ta_2O_5}$ optical coatings is the largest contributor of Brownian noise in LIGO compared to estimated substrate and suspension thermal noise \cite{Harry:06}. As of the end of O3, Brownian thermal noise is estimated to be ? orders of magnitude below the current sensitivity and it will prove to be the limiting source of noise as that sensitivity is increased with various other upgrades mitigating fundamental and technical noise. (\textcolor{red}{already mentioned in intro prior to this thermal noise section. Need to re-iterate in more detail?})

Electro-optic experiment (setting up, things tried, and final results):

Setting up
The experimental layout is based on a PDH servo design with the introduction of a electrostatic drive mount assembly for the flat GaAs / AlGaAs cavity end mirror. Given the size of the effect, the servo does best to sense the effect when the cavity length is small (\nabla L / L  = \nabla f / f). The cavity length was chosen to be as short as possible (L_cav = .1665m) with constraints determined by the shortest cavity length achievable with the lab optics inventory (Two PL-CC ROC=.333m by [CVI Melles-Griot and ATFilms], and PL-PL GaAs/AlGaAs sample) to construct a geometrically stable cavity.

\chapter*{Abstract}
Since the first gravitational wave detection, the Laser Interferometric Gravitational Wave Observatories (LIGO) combined with an expanding and co-observing global gravitational wave network (i.e. Virgo, KAGRA) has worked to increase a novel and growing astronomical data catalog of gravitational wave detections. With each additional observing run, rates of detection continue to increase with iterative upgrades to detector technology. Discussed within this thesis are considerations pertinent to the improvement of Dual Recycled Fabry-Perot Michelson interferometer (DRFPMI) thermodynamics proposed during LIGO's third observing run (O3) for present and future detectors. The first chapter reviews fundamental material relevant to gravitational waves and how DRFPMI are used to detect them. The second discusses comissioning work on LIGO's thermal compensation system during O3 for detector operation at high power. The third introduces thermal noise and birefringent noise for a proposed highly reflective crystalline ($\gaas$/$\algaas$) coating candidate propped up for its ultra-low thermal noise properties. The fourth proposes a measurement strategy to acquire a calibrated electro-optic noise estimate. The fifth is a published paper providing a calibrated electro-optic response. The final chapter provides conclusive retrospection of the work covered in the prior chapters.

\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
There are a number of people I’d like to thank who contributed significantly to my efforts contained in this dissertation:

First, I’d like to thank my advisor Stefan. The brilliant perspectives you provided never ceased to amaze me. Not only that, but the time while doing this dissertation work has been the most challenging of my life and you took time to let me learn in the lab at my own pace and surrounded me with wonderful collaborators. 

To Fabian Maga\~{n}a-Sandoval and Gabriela Serna. You were with me through the highest of highs and lowest of lows. The countless hours of engaging conversation in and out of the lab constantly live in my mind and the lessons taken from them are an invaluable part of who I am. I’m forever grateful to you both. 

To Duncan Brown, for helping us grad students get that big picture perspective.

To Peter Saulson, for showing me that behind every idea there is a scientist who most likely spent a lot of time to formulate and organize it, and for the fantastic stories about quick and dirty solutions that are sometimes enough to do really interesting science.

To Erik Muniz, Ari Pedersen, Derek Davis, Varun Srivastava, Steven Reyes, Nick Didio, Soumi De, Daniel Finstad, and Elenna Capote for all the shared ideas, laughs, and tears that molded us through this common grad school experience. 

To Lorena Magaña-Zertuche and Mike Senatore, for all the times we struggled and got through first year problem sets and practice exams together, all while still having fun. 

To Thomas Vo, for keeping me in the loop during all the talks and meetings about the Hanford detector and for reminding me the value in saying more with less. 

To Satoshi Tanioka. Research during the pandemic was starting to feel tricky but the clear and fresh perspectives you brought to the lab kept me focused on the important things.

To the LIGO Hanford / Caltech crew. To Daniel Sigg, Shiela Dwyer, Jenne Driggers, Jeff Kissel, Peter King, Aidan Brooks, and Terra Hardwick for taking the time to teach me priceless skills and letting me heat the core optics all hours of the day. To Dan Brown, Georgia Mansell, and Craig Callihane for letting me stick by you all hours of the night poking at the detector while playing some of my favorite tunes. To Mike Laundry, Sheila, and Jenne, for reminding me of my humanness when working on ambitious scientific projects.

To Phil Arnold, Charlie Brown, and Dave Pratt. You treated me like family in the machine shop and humored all of my ideas. Thanks for your infinite patience and letting me get my hands greasy.

To Josh Smith and Mike Loverude, for showing me early on the joys of collaborative science.

To Jenny Ross, for helping provide practical solutions to organizing all the work I have done for the audience I want to reach. 

To my family. My mom Michele, my sister Erin, my brother Mikey, my dad Charles, and my nana Alice. Without the love and hard work from you, I don’t think I would have had the opportunity to satisfy the curiosity that this field has so far fulfilled. Thanks for believing in me.

To the Duffys. Your love, guidance, and understanding during these last few years have helped me immensely in completing this chapter of my life.

To Jimmy and Porkchop the dog. You’re my world. Thanks for always grounding me.
